| **The 4 Questions Game** |
| --- |
| ***(Essential BEFORE Starting my assessment)*** |

**1- What do I expect from this assessment?**

What specific points would I particularly like to address and/or clarify?

I expect this assessment to help me understand how to build my professional profile, clearly understand my expectations, and define the different paths/projects to explore in my job search. I therefore want to address my background and skills to have a solid profile/resume. Clarify my expectations and define the options that suit me going forward.

**2- What is my mindset for undertaking this assessment?**

What reasons are driving me to do this assessment? What are the reasons my company is financing this assessment?

**Me**: I'm a bit lost and don't want to miss my chance, being at a crossroads in my career: I'm coming out of 2.5 years of experience in the medical field as an Embedded Software engineer (during which I was able to develop my skills and become Senior, Technical Project Leader, etc.) but might want to change fields. I studied Machine Learning and am very interested in the recent growth of the LLMs market; I've been self-teaching in model development and deployment for 2 months. I'd therefore like to give myself the best chances by making the right decisions, presenting myself in the best light, and channeling my efforts intelligently.

**3- How do I view my career path today?**

And how does my company view me?

**Me**: My career path seems very good to me: I started as a consultant placed in a company but left before the end of my trial period to join my previous employer (in the medical field). I started as a simple developer but quickly took on responsibilities and occupied a more central role in firmware development (demos, PoCs, clinical trials, etc.) and in certain test infrastructures and regulatory documentation. Having worked in the restaurant industry (bar and restaurant) during my studies, I have experience in customer contact, "sales," and I even designed and taught Python courses to MBA students (older, international, and new to programming).

My company has a very positive view of me, as someone who is hardworking, responsible, committed, and with a good sense of analysis, critical thinking, and communication.

**4- What project(s) can I envision for the future?**

For now, 4 projects:

1) Development of a refrigerator temperature monitoring system for restaurateurs. The idea would be to develop a complete system (sensors, central gateway, and server) and offer this service to restaurants. A somewhat uncertain plan launched with a very good friend, himself a restaurant professional. We are currently developing prototypes (on the right track). The idea would be to develop the product and start a company. I handle the technical side and my friend the sales/business side (everything would take shape within a year).

2) Development of a dialysis/plasmapheresis machine: I am in charge of developing the device's firmware and, with my former boss and some former colleagues, launching this product and starting a company. I am the firmware lead and would have shares in the company. No income for 2 years, if all goes well.

3) Continue my transition to Machine Learning/AI and find an engineer/consultant position in this field.

4) Find a Senior Embedded Software engineer job elsewhere.

The first two plans are uncertain (not sure if the company will work or if the product will be completed).

Serious, focused, and rather calm but energetic and enthusiastic. Not necessarily expansive at first, but accessible and attentive. |
| **My image in the company** | **Possible interpretation by my hierarchy** |
| Reliable worker, with a real ability to structure, analyze, and unite. Versatile and ready to adapt. Great team spirit and always willing to help or participate in team activities. | Profile of trust, discreet leader, quiet strength. I am entrusted with responsibilities because it's known that I deliver and show distance. Perceived as a technical driving force, and good relay in complex situations. |

**My functioning**

| **My management style** participative, directive, non-directive, ... |
| --- |
| I explain, I simplify, I mobilize. I know how to identify who can do what, and I delegate with confidence. I know how to recognize the strengths of others. I value progress, I support those who are less comfortable, I maintain a benevolent and demanding posture. People often come to me for advice, to make decisions, or to arbitrate clearly. |
| **CONCEPTION**, quick analysis (of the situation, opportunities, strengths and weaknesses of the environment), synthesizes, anticipates (short, medium, long term), identifies emergencies, defines priorities, adds value in resolving situations, defines a strategy, operational objectives, thinks outside the box, questions preconceived ideas, suggests new ideas or ways to solve situations, or improve existing ones, triggers opportunities, implements organizations and operating modes. I quickly identify priorities, problems, and potential for evolution in a project. I am able to analyze a complex situation, make a clear synthesis, and propose concrete avenues. I naturally anticipate risks and future technical needs. I challenge ideas, but always in a constructive and argued way. I think before acting, but I act quickly once the vision is clarified or when circumstances demand it. |
| **ACHIEVEMENT**, focuses on problem solving, defines my actions, means, resources needed to achieve results, goes all the way to achieving results, maintains and defends my objective, assumes my responsibilities, argues the decisions I make, decides, allocates resources to my decisions, specifies the means, deadlines, results to act, organizes, plans, ensures follow-up, coordinates. I go through with what I undertake. I define my objectives, I structure my action plan, and I adapt if necessary. I like to understand the issues to prioritize intelligently. I document, I test, I correct, I validate. I am rigorous, autonomous, and always in a logic of sustainable results. I defend my choices, but I remain open to listening. |
| **Animation**, shows confident, assured and determined toward the team, colleagues, superiors, explains and unites around common objectives and results to be achieved, identifies the competent employee to carry out a job or mission, transmits tasks to be performed, solicits autonomy and skills, delegates, controls, objectively evaluates skills and behaviors to identify strengths and development needs, identifies all opportunities for individual and collective development (new missions, training...), Encourages entrepreneurship from a development perspective, identifies sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the team, remains available to support my team, ... I have regularly initiated group dynamics to break out of the beaten path and find new solutions, especially in highly structured technical contexts. I naturally put forward proposals then support the creation of new ideas, and facilitate interdisciplinary discussions to evaluate feasibility. I easily take on the role of idea catalyst, without imposing, but by connecting, stimulating, structuring. Innovation, for me, is born from intelligent facilitation: making others want to dare, then making ideas exist. |
| **RELATIONSHIP** Initiates contact, adopts an active approach, builds confidence: shows openness, transparency, expresses myself in a structured, precise and clear manner, shows availability, gives time to others, demonstrates empathy, reformulates, explores in depth, seeks to understand, highlights the positive aspects of change, shows flexibility towards different projects, missions, actions to be carried out, remains calm and composed in conflict situations, controls my emotions and manages my stress, remains objective and factual, promotes information exchange between different services, units..., encourages, ... I am transparent, clear, composed. I really listen to others. I try to understand before responding. I generally have good control of my emotions but may let them show in tense situations. I appreciate human relationships based on respect, trust, and clarity. I am perceived as someone reliable and stable, capable of being a driving force, but also an anchor point in a team. |

| **ACTIVITIES** | Do I have **pleasure** in doing it? | Give illustrations of cases where you performed the activity in question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research | Y | Entrepreneurial project on IoT sensors for catering, I conceptualized the entire system architecture, from sensor to server. At Tandem, I designed several firmware sub-modules as well as the system, certain test tools, etc. |
| Analyze | Y | Data analysis to characterize a signal at Tandem, case analysis to define the architecture of clinical trial firmware, etc. |
| Synthesize | Y | Teaching at IMD. Presentation of sub-project at Tandem |
| Interpret | N/A | ? |
| Solve problems | Y | During the firmware development for the clinical trial, I took charge of blocked technical situations and found creative solutions under strong regulatory pressure. |
| Optimize, rationalize | Y | At Tandem, the limited resources of the pump forced us several times to optimize the memory used and operations performed |
| Develop budgets | N | N/A |
| Manage projects | Y | At Tandem, I managed the planning, breakdown, and prioritization of firmware sub-projects. Particularly on the double pump system and the HIL bench, where I directed the definition of the backlog, milestones, and ensured the follow-up of deliverables in a regulated context. During my Master's project, I defined and then led the project autonomously, same for Bleu Lézard and the IoT startup. |
| Manage processes | N | Implementation and continuous improvement of the firmware test process at Tandem (FIH, HIL + validation procedures). Integration into the QMS and regular monitoring of non-conformity cases. |
| Manage people | Y | As a technical reference, I supervised more junior colleagues, distributed tasks according to their strengths, and provided benevolent but structuring support. My role was often to clarify, unblock, and help develop skills. |
| Organize | Y | Complete organization of the technical roadmap for the FIH firmware: definition of priorities, breakdown into sprints, management of critical dependencies. Also during the IoT entrepreneurial project, where I structured the prototype development stages. Co-piloting of PI Planning. |
| Make decisions | Y | Identification and resolution of a critical Bluetooth bug. I had to decide on the partial refactoring of the module, argue in front of the team, and take responsibility for the fix, under regulatory constraints and tight schedule. |
| Direct | Y | Technical lead on critical sub-projects (FIH, HIL, double pump). I assumed the technical vision, directed common efforts, and coordinated the disciplines involved. My reference posture naturally established itself in these contexts. |

| **ACTIVITIES** | Do I have **pleasure** in doing it? | Give illustrations of cases where you performed the activity in question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Take initiatives | Y | I proposed the creation of a HIL bench when it was not initially planned, and designed a first version alone. I also initiated a log visualization tool to facilitate interdisciplinary debugging. In my personal projects, I initiate everything. |
| Drive | Y | I was at the origin of the HIL system implementation and the occlusion signal characterization study. I often identify gaps or friction points, then propose a concrete and unifying solution. |
| Change | Y | After 2.5 years in MedTech, I embarked on a partial transition to applied AI, training myself autonomously and restructuring my professional positioning. Also, I've always been able to react to difficult internal evolutions. |
| Follow files | - | As part of the FIH firmware, I followed all phases of the project: specifications, implementation, tests, regulatory documentation. I also ensured traceability and verification matrices, in connection with QA. |
| Innovate | Y | Each entrepreneurial project launched (IoT, MedTech) is based on an innovative idea. Same for the Master project: design of a compact AI embedded system replacing heavy hospital equipment. |
| Imagine | Y | Creation of original architectures for complex systems, like the double pump or the ASIC electrode. I often start from a vague need to propose a clear, coherent, and technically viable solution. |

| Support others | Y | As a technical reference, I help my colleagues understand certain specs, structure their code, or organize themselves. I also individually accompanied struggling MBAs during my courses at IMD. |
| Advise others | Y | I am often consulted for a structured opinion on a technical choice. I give advice based on analysis, without imposing, respecting each person's constraints (time, level, stress). |
| Implement strategies | - | For each technical sub-project, I develop a strategic approach (objectives, deliverables, tools, resources). In the IoT entrepreneurial project, I defined a scalable architecture according to commercial scenarios envisaged. |
| Train | Y | Design and facilitation of Python/ML courses at IMD for international MBAs. I also trained colleagues in Python and the tools I had created (simulators, dashboards, test frameworks). |
| Facilitate | Y | I often play a facilitator role in multidisciplinary technical discussions (HW, QA, system). I clarify, reformulate, synthesize so that we advance together faster and more serenely. |
| Listen | Y | Natural ability to actively listen to my colleagues or collaborators, especially in complex or tense situations. I reformulate, I take into account blocking points, then I act in an appropriate manner. |
| Communicate in writing | - | Complete writing of specs, SRS, design documentation, test reports, and Master's thesis. I make it a point of honor to produce clear, accessible, and well-structured documentation. |
| Communicate orally | Y | Technical presentations in English at IMD, demos to stakeholders at Tandem, daily discussions with very varied profiles (RA, QA, hardware, software). Participation in workshops in English, etc. |
| Influence | Y | Without a hierarchical role, I've often influenced technical decisions through my structured arguments and clear vision. My leadership naturally imposed itself on several sensitive sub-projects. |
| Negotiate | N | Limited but concrete experiences: negotiation of technical constraints in the ASIC project (latency, bandwidth) with physicists and electronics engineers. Also, discussion of project priorities in sprint planning at Tandem. |

| **ACTIVITIES** | Do I have **pleasure** in doing it? | Give illustrations of cases where you performed the activity in question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manage unforeseen events | Y | Strong example: critical incident on a Bluetooth module during the FIH project. I led the RCA analysis for several weeks and adjusted the development plan to meet deadlines despite unanticipated technical blockages. Also all the changes in strategy and organization while maintaining certain objectives. |
| Produce | Y | I produced concrete technical deliverables: certified firmware, functional HIL test bench, normative documentation, internal software tools, and physical entrepreneurial projects (prototypes, interfaces, etc.). |
| Implement | Y | Implementation of the Bleu Lézard network, the embedded system for the IoT project. Also at Tandem with the implementation of firmware for clinical trials. |
| Build | Y | Design and construction of technical systems from A to Z: HIL test bench, double pump architecture, ASIC prototype. Ability to go from the need to the object that runs in hand. |
| Classify | N | Organization of firmware documentation in the QMS (Quality Management System), structuring of specs and traceability matrices. Need to classify everything to comply with ISO/IEC standards in medical. |
| Install | - | Installation of a complete network infrastructure for Bleu Lézard: cabling, firewall, network topology. Setup of the test environment (HIL) at Tandem as well. |
| Maintain/Maintenance (only) | N | Not a central activity in my career, but I maintained the computer network of Bleu Lézard, and updated the HIL when the firmware evolved (compatibility, new test cases, logs). |

**ANALYSIS OF 3 DIFFICULT SITUATIONS**

Fill in the document objectively and discuss it in an interview with your consultant.

| **Situation** | **Behaviors/attitudes** | **Reflections/lessons** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1.** Removal of my managers and management of the critical load (FIH firmware) **Context** 8 months after my arrival, my N+1 and his N+2 were laid off. I took over a large part of their responsibilities on a critical medical project (First-In-Human firmware), without formal recognition or handover training. **What I felt / experienced** - Feeling of abandonment then over-responsibility. - Difficulty being legitimate in a vague role. - Lack of hierarchical support, little clarity in expectations. | • I took technical leadership out of necessity: structuring the backlog, interdisciplinary coordination, regulatory documentation. • I maintained clear communication, despite the ambient tensions. • I delivered a system on time that was accepted for clinical trials — under strong pressure. | • I am capable of holding firm in unstable terrain. • But I also learned that leadership **without recognition** can lead to abuse. • I started to reflect on what I want (and no longer want) in a structure. |
| **2.** Unfair performance review & near burnout **Context** 6 months after the crisis mentioned above, I received a performance review "below average," based on factually erroneous elements, without my former superiors (the only ones able to defend me) being able to intervene. **What I felt / experienced** - Injustice, frustration, loss of confidence in the hierarchy. - Emotional exhaustion: 2 months of battle to obtain a work certificate and assert my rights. - Pre-burnout signs: loss of motivation, anxiety, irritability. | • I objectively documented my deliverables, my work, my various evaluations and interactions with the hierarchy. • I demanded a work certificate to protect my future reputation and formally establish the roles and responsibilities actually taken. • I began a real reflection on my professional repositioning. | • I now know how to recognize the weak signals of a destructive environment. • I will no longer wait until I'm at the end of my rope to set my limits. • This episode gave me immense clarity on what I'm worth and on what I want to build in the long term. |
| **3.** Prolonged analysis of a critical Bluetooth bug (FIH firmware) **Context** As part of the First-In-Human project, erratic behavior of the Bluetooth module compromised firmware stability. The bug was intermittent, difficult to trace, and occurred at a critical validation stage. No colleague mastered the concerned part. **What I felt / experienced** - Frustration with the opacity of the problem and the inheritance of technical debt that led to the situation. - Technical solitude: no expert available, no one to validate my hypotheses. - Implicit pressure: the clinical calendar was advancing, without a clear outcome. | • Implementation of a precise test protocol to capture the bug. • Methodical analysis: crossed logs, tested hypotheses, progressive elimination of causes. • Writing detailed documentation for the diagnosis to be understood. • Regular communication with QA and management, even in the absence of a "result". | • Patience and method take precedence over haste in case of a difficult bug. Implement rigorous processes as soon as possible to document the situation and investigation efforts. • One must dare to "not know right away," but remain transparent. • I strengthened my ability to set a technical framework in the fog — and it served me on other projects afterwards. |
