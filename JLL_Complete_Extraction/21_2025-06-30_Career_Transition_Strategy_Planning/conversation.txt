I want your help finding the best approach(es) and online platforms to find the best job offers for me. 

Closely look at my profile, work certificates, etc.. 

I want you to research the best way for me to approach my career transition and come up with a custom plan that fits me and my projects. It can range from LinkedIn activities (profile modifications, etc.), finding the best platforms to find job offers, application strategies, etc..

Ask questions until you're sure you understand the task at hand

[2] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:01:45
--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking for help with their career transition strategy. They want me to:
1. Analyze their profile, work certificates, and documents
2. Research the best approaches for their career transition
3. Create a custom plan including LinkedIn strategies, job platforms, and application strategies

Before I can use the launch_extended_search_task tool, I need to understand their specific career goals better. Looking at their documents, I can see Arthur is an embedded systems engineer with AI/ML interests transitioning from medical devices. But I need to clarify some key points to make the research most effective.

Based on the documents, I can see:
- Arthur has 2.5 years at Tandem Diabetes Care as an embedded software engineer
- He has a Master's in CS from EPFL with Data Science specialization
- He's working on AI/ML projects (MultiModal Insight Engine)
- He's based in Lausanne, Switzerland
- He seems to be transitioning from embedded systems to AI/ML roles

I should ask clarifying questions about:
1. Target roles - what specific positions is he targeting?
2. Geographic preferences - is he open to relocating or remote work?
3. Timeline - when does he want to make this transition?

These questions will help me provide the most targeted research and recommendations.

I've reviewed your comprehensive profile and documents, Arthur. Before I dive into researching the best career transition strategies for you, I'd like to clarify a few important points to ensure I provide the most targeted recommendations:

1. **Target roles**: Based on your background in embedded systems and growing AI/ML expertise, what specific roles are you most interested in? (e.g., ML Engineer, Applied AI Engineer, or perhaps hybrid roles combining embedded systems with AI?)

2. **Geographic scope**: Are you focusing exclusively on opportunities in Switzerland (Lausanne/Geneva/Zurich area), or are you open to remote positions or relocating internationally?

3. **Timeline & current status**: What's your target timeline for this transition, and are you currently employed or actively job searching?

Once I understand these key factors, I'll conduct comprehensive research on the most effective platforms, networking strategies, and application approaches specifically tailored to your unique profile and goals.

[3] HUMAN - 2025-06-24T14:04:33
--------------------------------------------------
1. All 3 propositions fit me. But also consulting roles and firmware/embedded software developper in the medical device development field (secondary targets)
2. Lausanne or Geneva for on-site roles (or hybrid or remote), Zurich and other main Swiss cities for hybrid or remote positions. The only relocation I would accept would be New-York City but would be better in a few years so let's not focus on that.
3. I am actively job searching, but I benefit from unemployment and must apply to at least 6 jobs per month. Ideally, I would find a job by the end of September.

[4] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:04:42
--------------------------------------------------


Thank you for those clarifications, Arthur! Before I launch into comprehensive research on the best platforms and strategies for your career transition, I have a few specific questions to ensure I provide the most targeted recommendations:

1. **Language preferences**: Given your fluent English and native French, are you interested in positions at both French-speaking Swiss companies and international companies in Switzerland? Or do you have a preference?

2. **Company size/type**: Are you more interested in startups/scale-ups (where your entrepreneurial projects might be valued), established tech companies (like your Logitech application), or medical device companies specifically?

3. **Priority between roles**: Among your targets (AI/ML Engineer, Embedded+AI hybrid, Medical Device Firmware, or Consulting), which aligns best with your long-term career vision? This will help me prioritize the platform and strategy recommendations.

Once I have these details, I'll conduct extensive research on the most effective Swiss job platforms, LinkedIn optimization strategies specific to your profile, and tailored application approaches for your unique embedded-to-AI transition.

[5] HUMAN - 2025-06-24T14:07:47
--------------------------------------------------
1. Yes, I don't mind working exclusively in english 
2. Any size but,. if for a big company, I would like to work on impactful R&D projects.
3. Firt Embedded+AI hybrid, then AI/ML Engineer, then Consulting, then Medical Device Firmware

[6] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:08:02
--------------------------------------------------


Perfect, I have all the information I need. I'll now conduct comprehensive research to find the best platforms and strategies for your career transition from embedded systems to AI/ML roles in Switzerland.

I'll research:
- Top Swiss job platforms for tech/AI/embedded roles
- LinkedIn optimization strategies for embedded-to-AI transitions

[7] HUMAN - 2025-06-24T14:21:21
--------------------------------------------------
I was thinking of implementing an AI-powered newsletter generation platform with a friend, would that fit in the portfolio development ?


Otherwise I liked your guide, but let's now address each section and come up with a plan for each.

[8] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:22:08
--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking about whether implementing an AI-powered newsletter generation platform would fit into their portfolio development for their career transition from embedded systems to AI/ML roles. They also want to address each section of the guide I provided and create actionable plans.

This is a fairly clear request that doesn't require extensive research - I can answer based on my knowledge and the context already established. The user is asking for:
1. Whether an AI-powered newsletter generation platform would be a good portfolio project
2. To go through each section of the guide and create specific action plans

This doesn't require the launch_extended_search_task tool as it's more of a strategic planning discussion based on the information already gathered. I should provide direct advice and help them create actionable plans for each section.

Absolutely! An AI-powered newsletter generation platform would be an **excellent** portfolio project for your transition. It demonstrates several key competencies that AI/ML employers value:

- **LLM Integration**: Shows practical experience with language models and API implementation
- **Data Pipeline Development**: Newsletter generation requires content processing, summarization, and curation
- **Production System Design**: Moving beyond toy projects to something people actually use
- **Full-Stack Thinking**: Combines backend AI with user-facing functionality

This project particularly shines because it's collaborative (showing teamwork) and practical (solving a real problem). It would fit perfectly as one of your three essential portfolio projects.

[9] HUMAN - 2025-06-24T14:32:57
--------------------------------------------------
I've been using a document like the one attached to try and follow-up on my activities, but it's very tedious to use and, in the end, not kept up to date. 

Help me find a system that will help me not get lost, with all those things to do (and the summer with plenty of family events and things of the like to "disrupt" my schedule)

Do not necessarily suggest a solution right away, let's find one that works first and then apply it to my plan.

[10] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:33:11
--------------------------------------------------


I understand the challenge - tracking job search activities, skill development, networking, and personal projects while dealing with life's interruptions is overwhelming. Before I help you find a system that actually works for your situation, let me understand your preferences better:

1. **What frustrated you most about the Excel tracking?** Was it the manual data entry, lack of reminders, difficulty accessing it on mobile, or something else?

2. **How do you naturally organize tasks in your daily life?** Do you prefer visual systems (like kanban boards), list-based approaches, calendar blocking, or something else entirely?

3. **What's your ideal balance between structure and flexibility?** Some people need rigid schedules while others prefer loose frameworks that adapt to changing priorities.

Understanding these aspects will help me suggest a system that you'll actually use consistently, rather than another tool that becomes a burden. I'm thinking about approaches that could integrate with your existing habits and handle the reality of summer disruptions while keeping you on track for your September job goal.

[11] HUMAN - 2025-06-24T14:45:20
--------------------------------------------------
1. Lack of reminder, tedious data entry and maybe inappropriate format (like column names, sheet separations,etc.)
2. I would organize my next week (what I want to achieve, depending on deadlines, personal priorities, mood,  unavailabilities, etc.) then "pre-assign" tasks for each day. I want it to have structure but allow for flexibility.
3.  As I said in my previous answer.

[12] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:45:33
--------------------------------------------------


Perfect, I understand your needs better now. You want a system that:
- Sends reminders (push/pull rather than you checking)
- Minimizes manual entry
- Allows weekly planning with daily flexibility
- Supports "pre-assignment" but easy reshuffling

A few more questions to nail down the right solution:

1. **Device preference**: Do you primarily work from your laptop/desktop, or do you need strong mobile access for on-the-go updates?

2. **Integration needs**: Would you prefer something that connects with your calendar (Google/Outlook) or stands alone? And would automated tracking (like detecting when you visit job sites) be helpful or feel invasive?

3. **Review style**: When tracking progress, do you prefer quick daily check-ins (5 min) or weekly reviews? And do you need detailed analytics or just "did I hit my targets"?

These answers will help me recommend whether you need a specialized job search tool, a flexible task manager with good recurring task features, or perhaps a hybrid approach combining calendar blocking with a lightweight tracker.

[13] HUMAN - 2025-06-24T14:47:02
--------------------------------------------------
1. No I work mostly on my laptop and can use my calendar/iphone for cross-device updates or reminders
2. I don't care. I don't necessarily need it to connect with my calendar, although it would be practical. No automated tracking.
3. I would like to update when I finish tasks, want to add new tasks, or plan the next week.

[14] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-24T14:47:31
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants a task management system for their job search that:
- Works on laptop with iPhone reminders
- Allows weekly planning with daily flexibility
- Minimal manual entry
- Updates when tasks are done or when planning
- No automated tracking
- Optional calendar integration

This is clear enough that I don't need clarifying questions. I should research task management systems that fit these criteria, specifically for job seekers.

Based on your needs, I'll research the best task management systems that offer weekly planning with daily flexibility, minimal data entry, and good reminder systems for job seekers. Let me find solutions that work well on laptop with iPhone notifications.

--------------------------------------------------
I was thinking of starting a project that uses typical techniques wanted in the industry : RAGs, Langchain, Prompt engineering, etc.  Let's explore that too.

Otherwise I liked your guide, but let's now address each section and come up with a plan for each.

[18] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-25T19:30:51
--------------------------------------------------


Excellent idea! Building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project would perfectly demonstrate your transition from embedded systems to AI/ML. Before I research the most effective industry-relevant project approaches and help create detailed plans for each section of the guide, I have a few quick questions:

1. **Project focus**: Would you prefer a technical documentation assistant (leveraging your embedded documentation experience), a medical device knowledge base (using your MedTech background), or something more general to showcase versatility?

2. **Timeline priorities**: Should we prioritize quick wins for immediate job applications (2-4 weeks) or build something more comprehensive that could become a portfolio centerpiece (2-3 months)?

3. **LinkedIn/networking comfort level**: Are you comfortable with regular posting about your learning journey, or would you prefer a more discrete approach focusing on direct applications and selective networking?

Once I understand these preferences, I'll research the latest industry expectations for RAG projects and create actionable plans for each section of the career transition guide!

[19] HUMAN - 2025-06-25T19:33:14
--------------------------------------------------
1. I just want a project that makes me showcase those skills and build an attractive portfolio. I like the medtech oriented ideas but I don't have data that I could legally use at hand. Good thinking tho, let's keep stuff like that in mind (medical or embedded system oriented, if appropriate and doable)
2. let's plan for 1-2 applications a week. I want something that will look good in my portfolio and demonstrate my skills with current industry technologies and standards
3. Not really no. I prefer a more discrete approach.

[20] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-25T19:33:40
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants to:
1. Build a RAG project for portfolio that showcases industry skills (without medical data constraints)
2. Plan for 1-2 applications per week, with a portfolio project that demonstrates current industry tech

The user has provided a detailed assessment of their current ML/AI skills after 7 weeks of intensive study. They've already built:
- Transformer architectures from scratch
- Vision Transformer (ViT) 
- Multimodal systems
- Model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning)
- Mixed precision training
- Custom training loops

This is significantly more advanced than I initially assumed. They're not starting from beginner level - they already have solid foundations and hands-on implementation experience. I need to revise my recommendations to:

1. Skip the basic learning phases
2. Focus on production-ready RAG systems that showcase their existing skills
3. Suggest more advanced projects that build on their transformer knowledge
4. Adjust the timeline since they can move faster
5. Focus on what they're missing: production deployment, MLOps, distributed systems

Let me revise the plan to match their actual skill level.Excellent point! You're absolutely right - you're far beyond beginner level. Let me revise the plan to match your actual capabilities and leverage your impressive foundation.

## Revised RAG Portfolio Strategy for Advanced ML Practitioner

Given your **7 weeks of intensive transformer implementation experience**, you can skip basic tutorials and jump directly to production-grade RAG systems. Your ability to implement transformers from scratch, work with multimodal systems, and optimize models puts you in an excellent position to build sophisticated RAG applications.

### Adjusted Timeline: 12-16 weeks (not 24)

You can move much faster given your foundation:
- **Weeks 1-4**: First production RAG system with advanced features
- **Weeks 5-8**: Sophisticated multimodal RAG leveraging your ViT experience  
- **Weeks 9-12**: Enterprise-grade system with full production stack
- **Weeks 13-16**: Polish, deployment, and interview preparation

### Updated Project Recommendations

**Project 1: Advanced Technical Documentation RAG (3-4 weeks)**
Building on your transformer expertise:
- Implement hybrid retrieval combining dense (your custom embeddings) and sparse methods
- Use your attention mechanism knowledge to build **cross-attention between query and documents**
- Implement **CRAG (Corrective RAG)** with your understanding of model confidence
- Deploy with proper production features: caching, monitoring, A/B testing
- **Differentiator**: Show how your custom transformer implementations improve retrieval

**Project 2: Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant (4-5 weeks)**
Leverage your ViT and multimodal experience:
- Build RAG system that understands **circuit diagrams, datasheets, and code**
- Use your Vision Transformer knowledge for technical diagram understanding
- Implement **multi-modal fusion** similar to your CLIP-style work
- Create custom embeddings for technical specifications
- **Differentiator**: Few people can build multimodal RAG from scratch like you can

**Project 3: Production LLM-Powered Development Environment (4-5 weeks)**
Showcase full-stack ML engineering:
- Build **agent-based RAG** using LangGraph for complex reasoning
- Implement your own **fine-tuned retrieval model** using your transformer code
- Add **online learning** capabilities to improve with usage

[27] HUMAN - 2025-06-26T14:35:57
--------------------------------------------------
Should I use pretrained models on some virtual server or should I directly use Claude/OpenAI API ?

[28] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-26T14:36:54
--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking about whether to use pretrained models on their own server or use commercial APIs like Claude/OpenAI for their RAG portfolio projects. This is an important decision that affects cost, performance, control, and what they can demonstrate to employers.

Let me think about the tradeoffs:

1. Using pretrained models on own server:
- Pros: Full control, can demonstrate deployment skills, no API costs, can customize/fine-tune, shows deeper understanding
- Cons: Need compute resources, more complex setup, slower inference potentially

2. Using Claude/OpenAI APIs:
- Pros: Easy to implement, high quality, fast, no infrastructure needed
- Cons: Costs money, less impressive technically, can't customize, dependency on external service

Given Arthur's background:
- He has strong technical skills and implemented transformers from scratch
- He wants to demonstrate ML engineering capabilities
- He's on unemployment benefits (budget conscious)
- He needs to show production-ready skills

I think a hybrid approach would be best - use both to show versatility, but lean towards self-hosted for the portfolio to demonstrate deeper skills.## Strategic Model Choice for Your Portfolio

Given your advanced ML skills and budget considerations, I recommend a **hybrid approach** that showcases both technical depth and practical judgment:

### Primary Strategy: Self-Hosted Models (70% of usage)

**Why this makes sense for you:**
- **Demonstrates real ML engineering skills** - anyone can call an API, but deploying models shows depth
- **Budget-friendly** - one-time compute cost vs ongoing API fees
- **Showcases your optimization skills** - quantization, caching, efficient serving
- **Full control** - custom fine-tuning, architecture modifications
- **Differentiates you** - most candidates just use APIs

**Recommended Setup:**
```python
# Use Hugging Face models on a modest GPU instance
- Hosting: Hugging Face Spaces (free GPU) or Runpod ($0.3-0.5/hour)
- LLM: Mistral-7B, Llama-2-7B, or Phi-2 (small but capable)
- Embeddings: Your fine-tuned sentence transformers
- Reranking: Cross-encoder models you can optimize
```

### Secondary Strategy: API Usage (30% of usage)

**When to use Claude/OpenAI:**
- **Baseline comparisons** - "Here's my optimized model vs GPT-4"
- **Complex reasoning tasks** - where you need SOTA performance
- **Rapid prototyping** - test ideas before optimizing
- **Fallback system** - demonstrate production thinking

**Cost Management:**
```python
# Smart API usage patterns
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for development ($0.002/1k tokens)
- Cache all API responses aggressively  
- Implement fallback to local models
- Show cost tracking in your demos
```

### Portfolio Implementation Plan

**Project 1: Technical Documentation RAG**
- **Primary**: Mistral-7B-Instruct on HuggingFace Spaces
- **Embeddings**: Your custom fine-tuned model
- **Comparison**: Show latency/cost vs OpenAI
- **Highlight**: "Reduced inference cost by 95% while maintaining 92% of GPT-4 quality"

**Project 2: Multimodal Assistant**
- **Vision**: Your ViT implementation + CLIP
- **Language**: Phi-2 or Mistral-7B
- **Demonstration**: Full self-hosted pipeline
- **Highlight**: "End-to-end multimodal system without external dependencies"

**Project 3: Enterprise Platform**
- **Architecture**: Hybrid with intelligent routing
- **Local**: Fast, cached responses
- **API**: Complex reasoning, fallback
- **Highlight**: "Production architecture balancing cost and performance"

### Technical Setup Recommendations

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Use llama.cpp for efficient inference
- Quantized models (GGUF format)
- Run on CPU or Apple Silicon
- Test everything locally first
```

**Deployment Options:**
```python
# Free/Cheap GPU Options
1. HuggingFace Spaces - Free T4 GPU
2. Google Colab - Free tier for demos  
3. Paperspace Gradient - Free tier
4. Modal.com - Generous free tier

# Production-like (worth the cost)
1. Runpod - $0.3/hour for demos
2. Vast.ai - Even cheaper spot instances
```

### What This Demonstrates to Employers

**Technical Skills:**
- Model deployment and serving
- Performance optimization  
- Cost optimization
- System architecture design

**Business Acumen:**
- Understanding cost/performance tradeoffs
- Building for scale
- Practical decision making
- Production thinking

### Specific Model Recommendations

**For General RAG:**
```python
# Best open models for your needs
LLMs:
- mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
- meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf  
- microsoft/phi-2

Embeddings:
- BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Your fine-tuned variants
```

**For Code/Technical:**
```python
# Specialized models
- codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf
- WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-7B-V1.0
- deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct
```

### Implementation Timeline

**Week 1**: 
- Set up local development with llama.cpp
- Test 3-4 open models locally
- Create cost comparison framework

**Week 2**:
- Deploy first model to HuggingFace Spaces
- Implement caching and optimization
- Add performance monitoring

**Week 3+**:
- Fine-tune embeddings for your domain
- Implement hybrid routing logic
- Showcase cost savings in UI

### Pro Tips

1. **Always show metrics**: Latency, cost/query, quality scores
2. **Implement graceful degradation**: API → Local → Cached
3. **Document your choices**: Why each model for each use case
4. **Create compelling comparisons**: "My optimized pipeline vs naive API usage"

This approach positions you as a **thoughtful ML engineer** who can balance technical excellence with practical constraints - exactly what employers want.

[36] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-27T07:55:04
--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking for a comprehensive setup guide for all the tools and services they'll need for their RAG portfolio projects. This is a clear and specific request that doesn't require clarifying questions. I should create a detailed, step-by-step guide that covers:

1. Development environment setup
2. Model hosting services
3. Vector databases
4. API services
5. Deployment platforms
6. Monitoring tools
7. Documentation resources

This is a technical guide request that I can handle directly without needing to launch a research task. The user needs practical, actionable setup instructions for each tool/service mentioned in the portfolio plan.

This guide provides everything you need to iteratively build your RAG portfolio. Start with Week 1 tasks and add services as needed. Each section is self-contained, so you can reference it when you reach that part of your project.

[37] HUMAN - 2025-06-29T10:22:26
--------------------------------------------------
Ok let's wrap this whole thing up.

Regather the whole context, the previous research results and everything we've exchanged so far and create a sort of preliminary document for the future projects. For each project, I want you to desribe its scope, draw it's general architecture, list all techniques, datasets, tools, platforms, etc.. used, links to associated resources. 

Think of it like the first draft of a Software architecture document (project context, description, solution strategy, building block and broad development steps/planning).

Make sure you understand the task at hand, ask any questions you might have, and then get started. Be thorough and focused on the practical and theoretical reference sides of my request.

[38] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-29T10:22:42
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create a comprehensive preliminary document for their RAG portfolio projects. This should be structured like a software architecture document with:

1. Project context
2. Description
3. Solution strategy
4. Building blocks
5. Development steps/planning

For each of the three main projects:
1. Advanced Technical Documentation RAG
2. Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant
3. Production LLM-Powered Development Environment

I need to include:
- Scope
- General architecture
- All techniques used
- Datasets
- Tools and platforms
- Links to resources
- Development planning

Let me structure this properly as a formal document that can serve as their reference throughout development.I understand the task perfectly. I'll create a comprehensive Software Architecture Document (SAD) for your three RAG portfolio projects, incorporating all our discussions, research findings, and your specific technical background. This will serve as your master reference document throughout development.

Let me structure this as a formal technical document with all the details you'll need. Before I begin, just to confirm:

1. Should I include cost estimates for various services/platforms?
2. Do you want me to include specific code architecture patterns (like class diagrams) or keep it at the system architecture level?
3. Should I add risk assessments and mitigation strategies for each project?

If you're ready for me to proceed with the standard architecture document format, I'll create a thorough reference document that covers all technical and practical aspects.

[39] HUMAN - 2025-06-29T10:31:38
--------------------------------------------------
1. Not necessarily not. But use the reports/guides generated before as you feel appropriate
2. Keep it at the system architecture level. All projects will be refined in a new claude conversation
3. Not necessarily no. But highlight any already identified risk. 
Also include, for each project, which skills/techno/etc.. it adds to my portfolio, and how to use it to demonstrate my abilities to recruiters.

[40] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-29T10:34:22
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants a comprehensive Software Architecture Document for the three RAG portfolio projects. Let me structure this properly:

1. Overall Portfolio Context
2. Project 1: Advanced Technical Documentation RAG
3. Project 2: Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant  
4. Project 3: Enterprise LLM-Powered Development Environment

For each project I need to include:
- Project context and scope
- Architecture overview
- Technical components and technologies
- Datasets and resources
- Implementation approach

[41] HUMAN - 2025-06-29T10:40:12
--------------------------------------------------
1. Not necessarily not. But use the reports/guides generated before as you feel appropriate
2. Keep it at the system architecture level. All projects will be refined in a new claude conversation
3. Not necessarily no. But highlight any already identified risk. 
Also include, for each project, which skills/techno/etc.. it adds to my portfolio, and how to use it to demonstrate my abilities to recruiters.

[42] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-29T10:42:45
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create a comprehensive Software Architecture Document for their three RAG portfolio projects. They want:

1. Use the previous reports/guides as appropriate (not necessarily cost estimates)
2. Keep it at system architecture level (not detailed code architecture)
3. Include already identified risks but not full risk assessment
4. For each project, include:
   - Which skills/technologies it adds to portfolio
   - How to use it to demonstrate abilities to recruiters

I need to create a thorough document that:
- Incorporates all our previous discussions
- Includes project context, description, solution strategy, building blocks, and development steps
- Has links to all resources mentioned
- Is practical and theoretical reference
- Shows how each project builds on the previous
- Clearly articulates the value proposition for recruiters

Let me structure this as a formal Software Architecture Document with all the requested elements.# RAG Portfolio Software Architecture Document

[43] HUMAN - 2025-06-30T08:59:17
--------------------------------------------------
Regather your context. 

Then create separate markdown for each project, for me to use as knowledge in a Claude project.

[44] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-30T08:59:48
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create separate markdown documents for each of the three projects. I need to review the context:

1. Arthur Passuello - embedded systems engineer transitioning to AI/ML
2. 7 weeks of intensive ML learning (transformers from scratch, multimodal systems)
3. 2.5 years embedded systems experience in medical devices
4. Looking for jobs in Switzerland (Lausanne/Geneva area)
5. Needs to build a RAG portfolio to demonstrate ML engineering skills
6. Prefers discrete job search approach
7. Currently unemployed, needs to comply with Swiss unemployment requirements

The three projects are:
1. Advanced Technical Documentation RAG
2. Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant  
3. Enterprise LLM-Powered Development Environment

Each markdown should be comprehensive and include all the relevant information from our discussions, formatted to be used as knowledge in a Claude project. I should include:
- Project overview and goals
- Technical architecture
- Implementation details
- Resources and datasets
- Skills demonstrated
- Timeline
- Deployment strategies
- Evaluation metrics
- How to position for recruiters

Let me create three separate, comprehensive markdown documents.I'll create three separate comprehensive markdown documents for each project, incorporating all our discussions and research. Each will serve as a complete reference for Claude project knowledge.

## Project 1: Advanced Technical Documentation RAG

```markdown
# Advanced Technical Documentation RAG System

## Project Overview

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Primary Goal**: Build production-grade RAG system demonstrating ML engineering fundamentals

### Business Context
Technical documentation for embedded systems is fragmented across PDFs, making it difficult for engineers to find specific implementation details quickly. Current search tools don't understand technical context, code relationships, or cross-references between documents.

### Solution
An intelligent documentation assistant that understands technical context, preserves code snippets, handles cross-references, and provides accurate answers with source attribution. The system demonstrates production-ready ML engineering with a focus on embedded systems documentation.

Regather your context. 

Then create separate markdown artefact documents for each project, for me to use as knowledge in a Claude project.

[46] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-30T09:05:42
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create separate markdown documents for each of the three RAG projects. I need to:

1. Review the context of our entire conversation to ensure I capture all relevant details

I'll create three artifacts:
1. Project 1: Advanced Technical Documentation RAG
2. Project 2: Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant  
3. Project 3: Enterprise LLM-Powered Development Environment

Each should be self-contained and include all necessary information for implementation.I'll create three separate comprehensive markdown documents for each project, incorporating all our discussions, research, and technical specifications. Each will serve as a complete knowledge base for your Claude projects.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

Now I'll create the second project document for the Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

Now I'll create the third and final project document for the Enterprise LLM-Powered Development Environment.
```

</pasted_content>

Now help me prepare a custom prompt for an assistant that will help me throughout this project.  You can find an example that worked rather well with the previous step of my transition, but I want to create a new one for this. Don't hesitate to ask questions for refinement. The custom prompt should remain the same for all projects (the markdown you generated will all be part of the knowledge as well as my github repository with their implementation and the guides/research reports you generated at the beginning of our conversation. So take that into account in the prompt (indicate what is in the knowledge and how to use it)



[48] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-30T09:34:43
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to help create a custom prompt for an assistant that will guide them through their RAG portfolio projects. They've provided an example of a previous custom prompt that worked well for their ML transition project.

Looking at the example, I can see it has:
1. Clear role definition (AI tutor and project guide)
2. Background and goals
3. Session structure
4. Current progress tracking
5. Project details
6. Roadmap
7. Instructions for each session
8. Preferences
9. Key areas of focus

For the RAG portfolio projects, I need to create something similar but adapted to:
- Three distinct RAG projects (not one progressive project)
- Focus on job search and portfolio building (not Anthropic specifically)
- Swiss tech market context
- Their current ML skills (7 weeks of intensive training)
- The resources in their knowledge base (architecture document, guides, research reports)

The prompt should:
- Define the assistant's role as a RAG portfolio development guide
- Reference the knowledge base documents
- Provide clear session structure
- Track progress across three projects
- Include their background and current skills
- Focus on practical implementation and job market positioning
- Be flexible enough to work across all three projects

Let me draft this custom prompt.Looking at your example prompt and understanding your new project context, I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions to create the most effective custom prompt:

1. **Session Focus**: Would you prefer the assistant to:
   - Guide you through one project at a time sequentially?
   - Allow you to work on multiple projects in parallel?
   - Be flexible to switch between projects based on your daily needs?

2. **Progress Tracking**: How would you like to track progress?
   - Detailed task completion like your ML transition (week by week)?
   - Sprint-based tracking (matching the backlog structure)?
   - Milestone-based (key deliverables for each project)?

3. **Technical Depth**: Given your advanced ML background, should the assistant:
   - Assume your transformer/ML knowledge and focus on RAG-specific concepts?
   - Help bridge your embedded+ML skills to production RAG systems?
   - Focus more on system design and architecture than ML fundamentals?

4. **Job Search Integration**: How prominent should job search guidance be?
   - Integrated into each session (e.g., "how does this feature help your portfolio?")?
   - Separate focused sessions for application preparation?
   - Minimal (focusing mainly on technical implementation)?

5. **Knowledge Base Usage**: The assistant will have access to:
   - The Software Architecture Document
   - All research guides and reports
   - Your GitHub implementations
   - The backlog and setup guides
   
   Should it reference these actively in each session or use them more as background context?

6. **Swiss Market Context**: How much should the assistant consider:
   - Swiss-specific technical preferences?
   - Cultural considerations in portfolio presentation?
   - Local company examples and market trends?

Based on your answers, I'll create a comprehensive custom prompt that balances technical depth with practical career transition needs, similar to your ML transition prompt but tailored for the RAG portfolio journey.

[49] HUMAN - 2025-06-30T09:40:23
--------------------------------------------------
1. I will specify at the beginning of each conversation the focus of the day, but I would like to be able to switch if needed. Also include some follow up section that I would update after each session
2. Detailed task completion like your ML transition and milestone based (I will use ClickUp for the "sprint" management
3. focus on RAG-specific concepts, help bridge your embedded+ML skills to production RAG system while keeping some focus on system design and architecture. I want the assistant to be very explanatory when it comes to new concepts/architecture (e.g. RAGs and stuff) but not get lost in ML fundamentals or theory
4. Minimal but it would still be worth mentioning what kind of skill/implementation is relevant for the industry and should be highlighted.
5. Architecture document should be used more as background context, same for the research guides and reports (but cited directly when appropriate) but the github implementations and backlog/setup gudies should be actively referenced.
6. It should clearly consider cultural aspects in portfolio presentation (and stay focused on applications that are relevant to the swiss-specific industry/job market/market trends

[50] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-30T09:41:16
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants a custom prompt for an assistant that will help them throughout their RAG portfolio project. Based on their answers:

1. They want flexibility to switch between projects but will specify focus at start
2. Detailed task completion tracking like ML transition + milestone-based
3. Focus on RAG concepts, bridging embedded+ML to production RAG, system design/architecture
4. Minimal job search guidance but mention relevant skills for industry
5. Architecture doc and research as background, GitHub and setup guides actively referenced
6. Consider Swiss cultural aspects and market relevance

I need to create a comprehensive prompt that:
- Establishes the assistant's role as a RAG portfolio development guide
- Includes their background and current skills
- Sets up session structure
- Defines the three projects clearly
- Includes progress tracking section
- Emphasizes practical implementation over theory
- Considers Swiss market context

Very good. 

Now Generate a markdown artefact document that includes the RAG Portfolio Development Backlog and integrates the Strategic Model Choice for my Portfolio

[54] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-30T10:02:44
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create a comprehensive markdown artifact that combines:
1. The RAG Portfolio Development Backlog I created earlier
2. The Strategic Model Choice recommendations

I need to integrate these seamlessly so it becomes a single, cohesive document that Arthur can use as his guide. I'll structure it logically with the strategic model choices informing the implementation details in the backlog.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

I've created a comprehensive markdown artifact that integrates both the RAG Portfolio Development Backlog and the Strategic Model Choice recommendations. The document is structured to show how the model choices inform each sprint's implementation, with specific cost considerations and deployment strategies throughout.

Key integrations I made:
1. Added model selection details to each relevant task
2. Included deployment platform recommendations with costs
3. Emphasized the cost-efficiency angle throughout
4. Added specific model recommendations for each project
5. Included infrastructure costs and free tier options
6. Made sure the hybrid approach (70% self-hosted, 30% API) is reflected in the implementation tasks

The document serves as a complete guide that Arthur can follow, with all the technical details, resources, and strategic considerations in one place.I've created a comprehensive guide that integrates your RAG portfolio backlog with the strategic model choices. The document emphasizes:

1. **Cost-efficient implementation** - Showing how to build production-grade systems for <$50 total deployment cost
2. **Technical depth** - Each project demonstrates your ability to implement from scratch, not just use APIs
3. **Progressive complexity** - Starting with Mistral-7B for simple RAG, advancing to multimodal systems, ending with enterprise-grade routing
4. **Practical metrics** - Every project includes cost/performance comparisons that employers care about

Key highlights of the integration:
- Each task now specifies which models to use and why
- Deployment recommendations favor free tiers (HuggingFace Spaces, Modal.com)
- Clear differentiation between when to self-host vs use APIs
- Emphasis on optimization techniques you already know (quantization, caching)

The guide positions you as someone who can build sophisticated AI systems while being mindful of operational costs - a rare and valuable combination in the current market.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or add more implementation details for particular tasks?

[55] HUMAN - 2025-06-30T10:05:12
--------------------------------------------------
1. Not necessarily not. But use the reports/guides generated before as you feel appropriate
2. Keep it at the system architecture level. All projects will be refined in a new claude conversation
3. Not necessarily no. But highlight any already identified risk. 
Also include, for each project, which skills/techno/etc.. it adds to my portfolio, and how to use it to demonstrate my abilities to recruiters.


Create a single Markdown artefact document 

[56] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-30T10:08:31
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create a comprehensive Software Architecture Document (SAD) for all three RAG portfolio projects in a single markdown artifact. I need to:

1. Gather all context from our conversation:
   - Arthur's background (embedded systems, 7 weeks ML experience with transformers)
   - Three projects: Technical Documentation RAG, Multimodal Embedded Systems Assistant, Production LLM-Powered Development Environment
   - Resources, tools, techniques discussed
   - Strategic positioning for job applications

2. For each project include:
   - Scope and context
   - General architecture
   - Techniques, datasets, tools, platforms
   - Links to resources
   - Skills demonstrated
   - How to present to recruiters
   - Development steps/planning
   - Any identified risks

3. Structure as a formal architecture document but keep it practical and reference-oriented

4. Use information from previous guides/reports as appropriate

5. Keep architecture at system level (not detailed code architecture)

Let me create a comprehensive document that serves as Arthur's master reference.

1. **Covers all three projects** with detailed architecture, scope, and implementation details
2. **Includes system-level architecture diagrams** (in ASCII art format for markdown)
3. **Lists all resources, tools, datasets** with direct links
4. **Highlights skills demonstrated** and how to position them for recruiters
5. **Provides development plans** with weekly breakdowns
6. **Identifies risks** that were discussed
7. **Includes cross-project considerations** for shared infrastructure

The document is structured as a formal SAD but remains practical and focused on Arthur's needs. It serves as a master reference that he can use throughout his portfolio development, with each project building on previous skills while demonstrating new capabilities.

The document specifically addresses:
- His transition from embedded systems to AI/ML
- How to leverage his existing expertise
- Swiss market considerations
- Practical implementation guidance
- Strategic positioning for job applications

This should give Arthur everything he needs to start implementing his portfolio projects with confidence.I've created a comprehensive Software Architecture Document that serves as your master reference for all three RAG portfolio projects. The document includes:

## Key Features:

1. **Complete Project Architectures**: System-level diagrams showing data flow, components, and interactions for each project

2. **Resource Compilation**: Direct links to all datasets, APIs, documentation sources, and tools mentioned in our discussions

3. **Skills Mapping**: Each project clearly identifies what technical skills it demonstrates and how to present them to recruiters

4. **Development Roadmaps**: Week-by-week breakdowns with specific tasks and time estimates

5. **Technical Stack Details**: Specific model recommendations, framework choices, and deployment platforms

6. **Recruiter Positioning**: Concrete achievement statements and interview talking points for each project

## Project Progression:

The document shows how each project builds on the previous:
- **Project 1** (Technical RAG): Establishes core RAG competencies with production features
- **Project 2** (Multimodal): Leverages your ViT/transformer experience for differentiation  
- **Project 3** (Enterprise): Demonstrates full production ML engineering capabilities

## Practical Elements:

- Shared infrastructure setup that works across all projects
- Progressive skill building from fundamentals to advanced
- Swiss market alignment considerations
- GitHub organization structure
- Quick reference links to all essential documentation

This document gives you everything needed to start implementation. Each project section is self-contained, so you can begin with Project 1 and reference the relevant sections as you progress. The architecture diagrams and resource lists ensure you won't need to search for information - it's all consolidated here.

Is there any specific section you'd like me to expand on or any additional information you need before starting your first project?
