# Phase Analysis Report
**Phase:** D  
**Conversations:** 19 (Job Offer Analysis Request - Sinotis), 23 (Scientific Visual Developer Job Opening)  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Analyst:** Claude Code

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW REMINDER:**
1. First, load all conversation data for this phase ‚úì
2. Then, RE-READ this template and the protocol documents ‚úì
3. Only then proceed with analysis (this prevents methodology drift) ‚úì

## Content Extraction Results

### **Content Extraction Guidelines**
**CRITICAL:** Only extract statements that represent substantive claims about the user's:
- Professional background and experience
- Technical skills and capabilities  
- Project achievements and outcomes
- Educational credentials
- Career goals and strategic insights
- Quantifiable metrics and results

**EXCLUDE:** Procedural requests, task instructions, conversation management, or statements that have no standalone meaning about the user's professional profile.

**Examples to EXCLUDE:**
- "Look at my resume and analyze it"
- "Let's work on the next section"
- "Make a plan for Claude Code"
- "Do some research on LaTeX"

**Examples to INCLUDE:**
- "I mentored 3-5 people at Tandem"
- "I achieved 90%+ test coverage"
- "I have EPFL Master's in Computer Science"

## Classification Matrix Integration

### **Truth Base Application**
**Pre-Analysis Setup:**
- [x] Load current `statement_classification_matrix.csv` (121 existing entries)
- [x] Read User_Category column for corrections (overrides Category column)
- [x] Filter User_Reviewed=YES items as authoritative truth base
- [x] Apply corrected classification rules to new analysis

### **CSV Updates for This Phase**
**New rows added to statement_classification_matrix.csv:**

```csv
ID,Statement,Source,Category,User_Category,User_Reviewed,Evidence_Reference,User_Notes,Last_Updated
D001,I recently passed a Software Architect ISAQB certification,Conv 19 User,ACCURATE,,NO,User direct statement confirms existing SK003,,2025-07-24
D002,I am working on some new projects for Docker/cloud skills,Conv 19 User,ACCURATE,,NO,User direct statement about skill development,,2025-07-24
D003,Teaching experience (100+ MBA students) - assistant restatement,Conv 19 Assistant,ACCURATE,,NO,Matches verified claim ED003/SI006,,2025-07-24
D004,Clinical trial firmware HIL test systems ML/AI projects ASIC medical devices,Conv 23 Assistant,ACCURATE,,NO,Matches verified projects PR001-PR003,,2025-07-24
