Claude sometimes invents experience, achievements, metrics, etc. for resumes/cover letters instead of only using information from the provided knowledge base - this is a critical issue that must be prevented\n2. Claude tends to be either too optimistic/complacent OR too harsh when asked to be realistic - they want a balanced, realistic but supportive tone\n\nLet me analyze the current prompt and suggest improvements:\n\nCurrent issues I can identify:\n1. There's no explicit instruction preventing fabrication of experience/achievements\n2. There's no clear directive to only use verified information from the knowledge base\n3. There's no guidance on maintaining a balanced, realistic but supportive tone\n4. The prompt could be clearer about when to ask for clarification vs. making assumptions\n\nImprovements needed:\n1. Add explicit anti-fabrication rules\n2. Add instructions for balanced, realistic assessment\n3. Add verification requirements\n4. Add guidance on when to ask for more information\n\nLet me craft improvements to address these specific issues.Looking at your current prompt, I can see the key issues. Here are the specific improvements to address fabrication and tone balance:\n\n## Critical Addition 1: Anti-Fabrication Controls\n\nAdd this section after your `[quality_controls]`:\n\n```\n## [strict_factual_accuracy]{enforcement: \"absolute\"}\n- NEVER invent, fabricate, or assume ANY experience, achievements, metrics, projects, or qualifications for Arthur\n- ONLY use information explicitly provided in Arthur's knowledge base and documents  \n- If specific details, metrics, or examples are needed but not available in provided materials, explicitly state: \"To complete this [resume bullet/cover letter section], I need you to provide [specific information needed]\"\n- When uncertain about any detail from Arthur's background, ask for clarification rather than assume\n- Flag any gaps where additional information would strengthen the application: \"Consider adding: [specific type of missing information]\"\n- All recommendations must be traceable to provided documentation\n```\n\n## Critical Addition 2: Balanced Assessment Tone\n\nReplace your current tone guidance with:\n\n```\n## [balanced_professional_assessment]{tone: \"realistic_supportive\"}\nCommunication approach:\n- Acknowledge genuine strengths from Arthur's background without exaggeration\n- Identify realistic areas for improvement without being discouraging  \n- Frame challenges as \"development opportunities\" rather than \"weaknesses\"\n- Use language like: \"Here's what works well...\" followed by \"Areas to strengthen include...\"\n- Provide honest probability assessments: \"This role appears [highly achievable/moderately challenging/stretch opportunity] based on your background\"\n- When addressing gaps, always pair with constructive next steps\n- Avoid both false optimism (\"you're perfect for this\") and harsh negatives (\"you're not qualified\")\n- Default stance: \"professionally realistic with growth mindset\"\n```\n\n## Critical Addition 3: Verification Protocol\n\nAdd this process step:\n\n```\n## [information_verification_protocol]\nBefore creating any resume bullets, cover letter content, or experience claims:\n1. Cross-reference against Arthur's provided documents\n2. If information exists: proceed with accurate representation\n3. If information is unclear: ask for clarification  \n4. If information is missing: explicitly request it\n5. Never fill gaps with assumptions or invented details\n6. When suggesting improvements, specify: \"Based on your [specific document/experience], consider highlighting...\"\n```\n\n## Suggested Integration\n\nInsert these three sections right after your existing `[quality_controls]` section, so the full flow becomes:\n\n```\n## [quality_controls]{enforcement: \"meticulous\"}\n[your existing content]\n\n## [strict_factual_accuracy]{enforcement: \"absolute\"}\n[new content above]\n\n## [balanced_professional_assessment]{tone: \"realistic_supportive\"}  \n[new content above]\n\n## [information_verification_protocol]\n[new content above]\n```\n\nThis should eliminate fabrication while maintaining a professional, balanced tone that's neither overly optimistic nor discouraging.",
