Above is this project's custom instructions. I am not satisfied with the following : 

* Claude sometimes starts to invent experience, achievements, metrics, etc.. for my resume or cover letter. This is EXTREMELY GRAVE AND MUST BE AVOIDED. Any claim must be supported by the extended knowledge I provided. otherwise it should just ask
* If left alone, Claude will be too complacent and too optimistic. When told to be grounded and face reality, it is too harsh. Find a way to indicate claude to STAY IN BETWEEN. Do be overly validating but also don't always put me down


Help me improve this prompt to address those issues

[2] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T15:22:48
--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking me to help improve their custom instructions for a Claude-based AI Career Transition Specialist. The key issues they want to address are:

1. Claude sometimes invents experience, achievements, metrics, etc. for resumes/cover letters instead of only using information from the provided knowledge base - this is a critical issue that must be prevented
2. Claude tends to be either too optimistic/complacent OR too harsh when asked to be realistic - they want a balanced, realistic but supportive tone

Let me analyze the current prompt and suggest improvements:

Current issues I can identify:
1. There's no explicit instruction preventing fabrication of experience/achievements
2. There's no clear directive to only use verified information from the knowledge base
3. There's no guidance on maintaining a balanced, realistic but supportive tone
4. The prompt could be clearer about when to ask for clarification vs. making assumptions

Improvements needed:
1. Add explicit anti-fabrication rules
2. Add instructions for balanced, realistic assessment
3. Add verification requirements
4. Add guidance on when to ask for more information

Let me craft improvements to address these specific issues.Looking at your current prompt, I can see the key issues. Here are the specific improvements to address fabrication and tone balance:

## Critical Addition 1: Anti-Fabrication Controls

Add this section after your `[quality_controls]`:

```
## [strict_factual_accuracy]{enforcement: "absolute"}
- NEVER invent, fabricate, or assume ANY experience, achievements, metrics, projects, or qualifications for Arthur
- ONLY use information explicitly provided in Arthur's knowledge base and documents  
- If specific details, metrics, or examples are needed but not available in provided materials, explicitly state: "To complete this [resume bullet/cover letter section], I need you to provide [specific information needed]"
- When uncertain about any detail from Arthur's background, ask for clarification rather than assume
- Flag any gaps where additional information would strengthen the application: "Consider adding: [specific type of missing information]"
- All recommendations must be traceable to provided documentation
```

## Critical Addition 2: Balanced Assessment Tone

Replace your current tone guidance with:

```
## [balanced_professional_assessment]{tone: "realistic_supportive"}
Communication approach:
- Acknowledge genuine strengths from Arthur's background without exaggeration
- Identify realistic areas for improvement without being discouraging  
- Frame challenges as "development opportunities" rather than "weaknesses"
- Use language like: "Here's what works well..." followed by "Areas to strengthen include..."
- Provide honest probability assessments: "This role appears [highly achievable/moderately challenging/stretch opportunity] based on your background"
- When addressing gaps, always pair with constructive next steps
- Avoid both false optimism ("you're perfect for this") and harsh negatives ("you're not qualified")
- Default stance: "professionally realistic with growth mindset"
```

## Critical Addition 3: Verification Protocol

Add this process step:

```
## [information_verification_protocol]
Before creating any resume bullets, cover letter content, or experience claims:
1. Cross-reference against Arthur's provided documents
2. If information exists: proceed with accurate representation
3. If information is unclear: ask for clarification  
4. If information is missing: explicitly request it
5. Never fill gaps with assumptions or invented details
6. When suggesting improvements, specify: "Based on your [specific document/experience], consider highlighting..."
```

## Suggested Integration

Insert these three sections right after your existing `[quality_controls]` section, so the full flow becomes:

```
## [quality_controls]{enforcement: "meticulous"}
[your existing content]

## [strict_factual_accuracy]{enforcement: "absolute"}
[new content above]

## [balanced_professional_assessment]{tone: "realistic_supportive"}  
[new content above]

## [information_verification_protocol]
[new content above]
```

This should eliminate fabrication while maintaining a professional, balanced tone that's neither overly optimistic nor discouraging.

Generate the full prompt

[4] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T15:24:32
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to generate the full prompt incorporating the improvements I suggested. I need to take their original prompt and integrate the three new sections I recommended in the appropriate places. Let me structure this properly:

1. Keep their original structure and role definition
2. Add the three new sections after the quality_controls section as I suggested
3. Make sure the flow is logical and maintains their original intent while addressing the fabrication and tone issues

Let me reconstruct the full prompt:```

Good. Now make me a prompt that will ask claude to thoroughly review the project's knowledge and then review my AI-oriented CV's quality and content.

[6] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T15:34:29
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to create a prompt that will:
1. Ask Claude to thoroughly review the project's knowledge base
2. Review their AI-oriented CV's quality and content

This should be a standalone prompt that incorporates the career specialist identity I just helped them create, but focuses specifically on CV review. It should:
- Use the project knowledge search function first
- Analyze the CV comprehensively
- Provide specific feedback based on the knowledge base
- Follow the strict factual accuracy and balanced assessment guidelines
- Be thorough and detailed

I should structure this as a clear, actionable prompt that Arthur can use.```
As my dedicated AI Career Transition Specialist, I need you to conduct a comprehensive review of my AI-oriented CV. 

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Before any CV analysis, thoroughly search and review my project knowledge base to understand my complete background, experience, projects, skills, and career context.

Then provide a detailed CV quality assessment covering:

**CONTENT ACCURACY & COMPLETENESS**
- Verify all claims against my documented experience (flag any gaps or inconsistencies)
- Identify missing experiences, projects, or achievements that should be included
- Check if technical skills accurately reflect my actual capabilities
- Assess whether the CV fully captures my embedded→AI transition story

**TECHNICAL POSITIONING FOR AI ROLES**
- Evaluate how effectively I'm positioned for AI/ML opportunities
- Analyze the strength of my technical skills presentation
- Review project descriptions for AI/ML relevance and impact
- Assess whether my embedded systems background is properly leveraged

**ATS & MARKET OPTIMIZATION**
- Review keyword optimization for AI/ML roles
- Evaluate formatting and structure for ATS compatibility
- Assess competitive positioning in the Swiss tech market
- Check alignment with current AI industry hiring practices

**SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Provide precise bullet point modifications (only based on documented experience)
- Suggest content reorganization or emphasis changes
- Recommend additions where I have undocumented relevant experience
- Flag areas where I need to provide additional information

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**
- Honest evaluation of CV strength for target AI roles
- Probability assessment for different opportunity levels
- Priority improvements ranked by impact

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Base ALL feedback on my actual documented experience
- When suggesting improvements, specify: "Based on your [specific experience/project], consider..."
- If information is missing for complete assessment, explicitly request it
- Maintain realistic but supportive tone throughout
- Reference specific details from my background in all recommendations

Please begin with the knowledge base review, then proceed with the comprehensive CV analysis.
