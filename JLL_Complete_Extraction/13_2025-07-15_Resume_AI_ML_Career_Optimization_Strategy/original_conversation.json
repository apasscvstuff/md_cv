I'll start by analyzing the current state of each project and then ask targeted questions to optimize them for each CV version.\n\n## Project 1: Technical Documentation RAG System (Jan 2025 - Present)\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n- **Appears in**: AI and consulting versions only\n- **Missing from**: Firmware, general, executive versions\n- **Focus**: RAG architecture, hybrid retrieval, technical metrics (99.5% chunk quality, <100ms latency)\n- **Technologies**: PyTorch, FAISS, BM25, Llama 3.2, Streamlit, Docker\n\n**Current Positioning**: Leading AI/ML project showcasing production-ready RAG implementation\n\n### Assessment Questions for Optimization:\n\n1. **Business Impact & Metrics:**\n   - What was the **business problem** this RAG system solved? (e.g., \"reduced documentation search time by X%\", \"enabled Y developers to find answers faster\")\n   - Do you have **user adoption metrics**? (number of queries processed, user satisfaction scores, time savings)\n   - Any **cost savings** or efficiency improvements you can quantify?\n\n2. **Technical Depth & Complexity:**\n   - What was the **dataset size** you processed? (number of documents, total corpus size)\n   - Any **performance comparisons** with existing solutions? (vs manual search, vs basic RAG)\n   - What **specific technical challenges** did you overcome in the hybrid retrieval implementation?\n\n3. **Version-Specific Positioning:**\n   - **Firmware version**: Should this appear at all? If yes, how to connect to embedded systems context?\n   - **Executive version**: What's the **strategic value** and **leadership aspect** of this project?\n   - **General version**: How to balance technical depth with accessibility?\n\n4. **Deployment & Production Readiness:**\n   - Is this deployed and being used by real users? If so, how many?\n   - Any **reliability metrics** (uptime, error rates)?\n   - **Scalability achievements** or considerations?\n\n**Questions for you:**\n1. What specific problem did this RAG system solve for users/organization?\n2. Do you have any usage metrics or user feedback data?\n3. How would you position this project's business value for executive audiences?\n4. Should this project appear in the firmware version, and if so, how would you connect it to embedded systems relevance?\n\nLet me know your thoughts on these aspects, and then we'll craft the optimized version for all CV variants!",

Configuration\n\n### Configuration Schema\n\nSee [Configuration Schema](./rag-interface-reference.md#4-configuration-schemas)\n\n### Key Settings\n\n```yaml\nplatform:\n  initialization:\n    timeout: 30s\n    parallel: false\n  health_check:\n    interval: 60s\n    timeout: 10s\n  monitoring:\n    enabled: true\n    collector: prometheus\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Operations\n\n### Health Checks\n\n**Endpoint**: `/health`\n- Aggregates all component health\n- Returns degraded if any non-critical component unhealthy\n- Includes dependency verification\n\n### Metrics Exposed\n\n- `orchestrator_requests_total`\n- `orchestrator_request_duration_seconds`\n- `orchestrator_errors_total`\n- `component_health_status`\n\n### Logging Strategy\n\n- Structured logging with request correlation ID\n- INFO: Request lifecycle events\n- WARN: Component degradation\n- ERROR: Request failures\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| Slow startup | Model loading | Pre-warm models |\n| High latency | Component bottleneck | Check component metrics |\n| Memory growth | Request state leak | Verify stateless operation |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Future Enhancements\n\n### Planned Features\n\n1. **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Change settings without restart\n2. **Request Prioritization**: QoS for different request types\n3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Tracing and profiling integration\n\n### Extension Points\n\n- Custom health check strategies\n- Pluggable monitoring backends\n- Request interceptors for preprocessing\n\n### Known Limitations\n\n- Single point of failure (mitigated by stateless design)\n- No built-in request queuing (use external queue if needed)\n- Configuration changes require restart"
