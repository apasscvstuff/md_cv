Let me look at your actual AI/ML foundation:\n\n**Your REAL AI/ML Background:**\n- **EPFL Master's in CS with Data Science specialization** (Machine Learning, Applied Data Analysis)\n- **Taught Python/ML concepts** to international business leaders (requires solid understanding)\n- **ASIC project with ML-based seizure detection** (practical implementation)\n- **Current sophisticated multimodal project** (transformer architectures, safety evaluation)\n- **2 months intensive self-directed advancement** (building on existing foundation)\n\nYou have **solid theoretical foundation + growing practical expertise**. You just lack **professional AI/ML work experience**.\n\n## **Better Professional Title Options:**\n\n### **Option 1:**\n> \"Senior Embedded Systems Engineer | Applied AI/ML Specialist\"\n\n### **Option 2:**\n> \"Embedded Systems Architect | AI/ML Implementation Specialist\"\n\n### **Option 3:**\n> \"Senior Technical Engineer | Applied AI & Machine Learning\"\n\n## **Summary Reframe:**\n> Senior Embedded Systems Engineer with proven expertise in safety-critical system development and solid foundation in AI/ML implementation. Combines EPFL Data Science specialization with hands-on experience in transformer architectures, multimodal systems, and ML-based embedded applications. Successfully delivered technical AI/ML education to 100+ international business leaders and currently developing advanced AI safety evaluation frameworks. Brings rigorous engineering methodology and regulatory compliance expertise to ethical AI consulting and responsible technology development.\n\n## **Key Reframing Points:**\n- **\"Solid foundation\"** vs. \"learning\" \n- **\"AI/ML implementation\"** vs. \"transitioning to\"\n- **\"Hands-on experience\"** (your current project)\n- **\"Currently developing\"** (active, not aspirational)\n\n## **Projects Section - Confident Positioning:**\n**Multimodal Insight Engine:**\n> \"Advanced AI/ML implementation project featuring transformer-based multimodal models, safety evaluation frameworks, and responsible AI development practices. Demonstrates practical expertise in PyTorch, model optimization techniques, and AI ethics evaluation methodologies.\"\n\nThis positions you as someone with **genuine AI/ML capabilities** who happens to be **applying them professionally for the first time** - which is exactly what this role seems perfect for.\n\n**The difference:** You're not \"learning AI\" - you're **applying your AI knowledge professionally**.",
