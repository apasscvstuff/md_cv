- Current skills section leads with "Medical Device Development" (needs AI/ML-first restructuring)
- Tag-based system with 5 versions (firmware, ai, consulting, executive, general)
- Enhanced commands for quantified achievements and role-specific content

## 🎯 Clarifying Questions for Optimal Skills Section

Before generating the optimized Skills section, I need to clarify a few strategic points:

### 1. **Target Job Alignment**
- Do you have specific AI/ML job postings you're targeting? This would help me prioritize which AI/ML technologies to emphasize first
- Are you focusing on Swiss/EU market, or considering global remote opportunities?

### 2. **Skills Development Status** 
Your prompt mentions "*maybe I should add skills that are not here yet*" - are there:
- AI/ML technologies you're currently learning/developing?
- Certifications you're pursuing (AWS ML, Google Cloud AI, etc.)?
- Skills you want to position as "developing" vs. "proficient"?

### 3. **Technology Stack Priorities**
From your background, I see strong capabilities in:
- **Production AI**: RAG systems, Constitutional AI, Transformer implementation
- **MLOps**: Docker, performance optimization, testing frameworks  
- **Safety/Compliance**: Medical device standards applicable to AI governance

Should I prioritize:
- **Research-oriented skills** (custom model development, safety frameworks)?
- **Production-oriented skills** (deployment, scaling, MLOps)?
- **Consulting-oriented skills** (strategic AI, business value, ROI)?

### 4. **Current Positioning Gaps**
Looking at your comprehensive background, are there any areas where you feel under-represented in the current skills presentation?

## 🚀 Ready to Proceed

Once I have these clarifications, I can deliver:
- **AI version**: Leading with AI/ML & Data Science, emphasizing production systems and safety frameworks
- **Role-specific optimization**: Each version will highlight relevant skills for that career path
- **Quantified integration**: Including your metrics (100+ students, 99.5% accuracy, etc.)
- **Strategic positioning**: Embedded expertise as valuable differentiator, not primary identity

Would you like to provide these clarifications, or should I proceed with my analysis of your existing background and make strategic assumptions for the Swiss AI/ML market?
