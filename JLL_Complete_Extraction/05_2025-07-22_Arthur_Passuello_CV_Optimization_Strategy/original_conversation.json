Let me analyze the current state systematically.\n\n## Document Review Analysis\n\n### Current Skills Section Status\nLooking at `sections/section_skills.tex`, I can see the skills are already well-structured with conditional logic. For the AI version, the current structure is:\n\n1. **Programming Languages** (Python Expert first)\n2. **Core Technologies** (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Computer Vision, NLP) \n3. **AI & ML Expertise** (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, RAG Systems, FAISS, etc.)\n4. **Technical Education** (100+ Students trained)\n5. **Medical Device Development** (still appears via `\\whennotrole{consulting}`)\n6. **Development Tools & Platforms**\n7. **Project Management & Communication**\n\n### Key Gap Analysis\nFrom reviewing Arthur's recent projects (Technical Documentation RAG, MultiModal Insight Engine), I notice several cutting-edge AI technologies he's using that aren't fully represented in the current skills:\n\n**Missing AI Technologies:**\n- Constitutional AI / AI Safety frameworks\n- MLflow / MLOps platforms  \n- Mixed precision training\n- Neural reranking\n- Hybrid retrieval architectures\n- Custom tokenization & model architecture\n- Red teaming / safety evaluation\n- Apple Silicon MPS optimization\n- Model evaluation frameworks\n\n### Critical Questions Before Optimization\n\n1. **Current AI Version Compilation**: The LaTeX shows `\\def\\cvversion{ai}` but the PDF provided appears to be the firmware version. Do you have a recent compilation of the AI version to see how skills currently appear?\n\n2. **Medical Device Positioning**: The current logic shows Medical Device Development in the AI version (via `\\whennotrole{consulting}`). Should this be:\n   - Removed entirely from AI version?\n   - Reframed as \"AI Governance/Regulatory Expertise\"? \n   - Kept but moved lower in priority?\n\n3. **Skills Priority Order**: For the AI version, should the category order be:\n   - AI & ML Expertise FIRST (before Programming Languages)?\n   - Or keep current structure but enhance AI categories?\n\n4. **Target Role Alignment**: Are you targeting:\n   - Pure ML Engineer roles?\n   - Applied AI/Production ML roles?\n   - AI Safety/Governance positions?\n   - Technical consulting with AI focus?\n\nThis affects which technologies to emphasize most prominently.\n\n**Before I proceed with optimization, could you clarify these points?** I want to ensure the improvements address the specific positioning challenges you're seeing rather than making assumptions about the optimal structure.",

      "text": "Now I can see the actual AI version of Arthur's CV in HTML format. This is incredibly helpful to see the current state. Let me analyze what I'm seeing:\n\n## Current Skills Section Analysis\n\nLooking at the current skills table in the AI version, I can see it's structured as a 3-column table:\n1. **Software Engineering** (left column)\n2. **AI & LLMs** (middle column) \n3. **Data Science** (right column)\n\n### Current Content Analysis:\n\n**Software Engineering Column:**\n- ✓ Python (Expert, 5+ years) - GOOD positioning\n- ✓ PyTorch (Custom architectures) - GOOD\n- ✓ TensorFlow/Keras\n- ✓ JAX (Functional transformers) - ADVANCED\n- ✓ JavaScript\n- ✓ SQL\n- ✓ PyTorch (Advanced, 3+ years) - DUPLICATED!\n- ✓ Transformers (Built from scratch) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Constitutional AI & Safety - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN  \n- ✓ MLOps (MLflow, experiment tracking) - SHOULD BE IN DATA SCIENCE\n- ✓ Multimodal Systems (CLIP, ViT) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Vector Databases (FAISS, BM25) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Neural Reranking - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Mixed Precision Training - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n\n**AI & LLMs Column:**\n- ✓ Transformer Architectures (Custom implementation) - GOOD\n- ✓ Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation - GOOD\n- ✓ Multimodal AI (Vision-Language Models) - GOOD\n- ✓ Production RAG Systems (99.5% accuracy) - EXCELLENT with metrics\n\n\n- ✓ MLOps & Experiment Tracking - COULD BE DATA SCIENCE\n- ✓ Neural Reranking & Hybrid Retrieval - GOOD\n- ✓ Model Optimization (Quantization, Pruning) - GOOD\n- ✓ Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing - GOOD\n- ✓ ML Training Design (100+ Students, 4.8/5.0 rating) - SHOULD BE SEPARATE CATEGORY?\n- ✓ Research Implementation (Papers to Production) - GOOD\n\nI notice additional advanced AI skills that demonstrate deep technical expertise. The skills span MLOps, model optimization, and practical AI implementation. Particularly impressive are the training design credentials and research translation capabilities. The metrics around student training (100+ students, 4.8/5.0 rating) showcase exceptional instructional and technical skills.\n\nThe next set of skills emphasizes safety and cross-cultural communication, which are critical in modern technical environments. Safety-first approaches and effective communication bridge technical and interpersonal domains, ensuring responsible AI development and global collaboration.\n\nKey observations reveal significant gaps in skill categorization. AI-specific technical skills are dispersed across columns, creating potential misalignment. Critical emerging technologies like custom tokenization, model architecture design, and advanced optimization techniques are currently underrepresented.\n\nStrategic skill mapping highlights important contextual considerations. Medical device expertise and embedded systems skills represent valuable differentiators, especially for specialized AI roles requiring deep technical and regulatory understanding. The current skill taxonomy lacks comprehensive integration of leadership, educational, and domain-specific technical competencies.\n\nThe proposed approach involves restructuring skills to create more coherent categories that capture the nuanced landscape of AI technical expertise. Consolidating scattered teaching and training skills into a \"Technical Leadership\" category could provide clearer professional positioning.\n\nKey strategic questions center on optimal skill representation: balancing breadth of technical capabilities with depth in emerging AI technologies, and ensuring alignment with evolving industry requirements for AI governance, medical AI, and regulatory compliance roles.Perfect! Now I can see the current AI version state. Let me analyze the skills section systematically.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLooking at these documents, I can now see the current state of Arthur's CV system much more clearly:\n\n## Current Issues I Can Identify:\n\n### 1. **Skills Section Problems in HTML Version:**\n\nLooking at the HTML version, the skills are in a 3-column table format:\n- **Software Engineering** | **AI & LLMs** | **Data Science**\n\n**Major Issues:**\n1. **Duplications**: \"PyTorch\" appears twice in Software Engineering column\n2. **Misplaced Skills**: Many AI-specific skills are in the \"Software Engineering\" column:\n   - \"Transformers (Built from scratch)\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Constitutional AI & Safety\" should be in AI column\n   - \"MLOps (MLflow, experiment tracking)\" should be in Data Science column\n   - \"Multimodal Systems (CLIP, ViT)\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Vector Databases (FAISS, BM25)\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Neural Reranking\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Mixed Precision Training\" should be in AI column\n\n3. **Cross-category Content**: Some skills appear in AI column that could be in other columns:\n   - \"ML Training Design (100+ Students, 4.8/5.0 rating)\" - could be separate category\n   - \"Cross-cultural Technical Communication\" - appears in both AI and Data Science columns\n\n### 2. **Build System Architecture:**\n\nFrom the `build_system.py` file, I can see this is actually a **markdown-based system**, not LaTeX! The system:\n- Uses YAML content files\n- Generates markdown\n- Converts to HTML/PDF via pandoc\n- Has conditional logic for different versions\n\nThis is different from what Arthur mentioned in his prompt about LaTeX system. The system uses:\n- `arthur-skills.yaml` for skills configuration\n- Version-specific filtering based on `versions` arrays\n\n\n- Priority system helps categorize skills into core, standard, and detailed levels\n\n### 3. **Missing LaTeX System:**\n\nFrom `cv.tex`, I can see there IS a LaTeX system, but the current HTML output seems to be from the markdown system. The LaTeX system has:\n- `\\def\\cvversion{ai}` - setting AI version\n- Conditional compilation with toggles\n- `sections/section_skills.tex` file\n\nI'll need to investigate which system takes precedence and how the priority levels interact with skill categorization.\n\nThe markdown system and LaTeX system appear to have different approaches to skill representation. I want to understand how these systems can be harmonized to create a comprehensive skills overview that captures Arthur's advanced AI technologies and expertise levels.\n\nThe skills configuration reveals significant gaps in the current representation, particularly around cutting-edge AI frameworks and methodologies that demonstrate deep technical expertise.\n\nImmediate focus will be on reorganizing the skills table to more accurately reflect the depth and breadth of technical capabilities, emphasizing core AI/ML technologies and specialized frameworks.\n\nThe proposed restructuring involves:\n- Consolidating redundant entries\n- Creating more precise categorical columns\n- Highlighting unique technical achievements\n- Removing duplicate skill listings\n- Elevating advanced AI methodologies to prominent positions\n\nSpecific improvements target creating a clear, non-repetitive skills narrative that showcases Arthur's sophisticated technical proficiency across AI development, safety, and production implementation.\n\nI'll need Arthur's confirmation on the proposed system architecture and column refinements before finalizing the organizational strategy.Excellent! Now I can see the current state clearly. I notice something important - you have **two different CV systems**:\n\n1. **Markdown/YAML System** (`build_system.py` + YAML files)\n2. **LaTeX System** (`cv.tex` + sections/section_skills.tex)\n\n## Critical Clarification Needed\n\n**Which system generated the HTML version you showed me?** This affects my optimization approach:\n\n- If it's from the **markdown system**: I'll need to modify `arthur-skills.yaml`\n- If it's from the **LaTeX system**: I'll need to modify `sections/section_skills.tex`\n\n## Skills Section Issues I Can See\n\nLooking at your current HTML skills table, I identify these major problems:\n\n### 1. **Structural Issues**\n- **PyTorch duplication**: Listed twice in Software Engineering column\n- **Category misplacement**: AI skills scattered across wrong columns\n- **Missing cutting-edge tech**: From your projects, you're using advanced techniques not listed\n\n### 2. **Strategic Positioning Problem**\nThe table headers suggest:\n- **Software Engineering** | **AI & LLMs** | **Data Science**\n\nBut AI-specific skills are mixed throughout, diluting the AI positioning.\n\n### 3. **Missing Technologies from Your Projects**\nBased on your RAG and MultiModal projects, you're missing:\n- Custom tokenization & model architecture\n- Safety evaluation frameworks  \n- Advanced optimization techniques\n- Research-to-production pipelines\n\n## Before I Provide Detailed Recommendations\n\n**Please clarify:**\n\n1. **Primary System**: Which system should I focus on - the markdown/YAML system or LaTeX system?\n\n2. **HTML Source**: Was the HTML version generated from markdown system or LaTeX system?\n\n3. **Medical Device Positioning**: Should medical device/regulatory expertise be:\n   - Completely removed from AI version?\n   - Reframed as \"AI Governance/Safety\" expertise?\n   - Kept but deprioritized?\n\n4. **Table Structure Preference**: Do you want to keep the 3-column format or explore alternatives?\n\nOnce I know which system to target, I can provide specific file modifications and optimization recommendations.",

Let me analyze what I'm seeing:\n\n## Current Skills Section Analysis\n\nLooking at the current skills table in the AI version, I can see it's structured as a 3-column table:\n1. **Software Engineering** (left column)\n2. **AI & LLMs** (middle column) \n3. **Data Science** (right column)\n\n### Current Content Analysis:\n\n**Software Engineering Column:**\n- ✓ Python (Expert, 5+ years) - GOOD positioning\n- ✓ PyTorch (Custom architectures) - GOOD\n- ✓ TensorFlow/Keras\n- ✓ JAX (Functional transformers) - ADVANCED\n- ✓ JavaScript\n- ✓ SQL\n- ✓ PyTorch (Advanced, 3+ years) - DUPLICATED!\n- ✓ Transformers (Built from scratch) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Constitutional AI & Safety - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN  \n- ✓ MLOps (MLflow, experiment tracking) - SHOULD BE IN DATA SCIENCE\n- ✓ Multimodal Systems (CLIP, ViT) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Vector Databases (FAISS, BM25) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Neural Reranking - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n- ✓ Mixed Precision Training - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN\n\n**AI & LLMs Column:**\n- ✓ Transformer Architectures (Custom implementation) - GOOD\n- ✓ Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation - GOOD\n- ✓ Multimodal AI (Vision-Language Models) - GOOD\n- ✓ Production RAG Systems (99.5% accuracy) - EXCELLENT with metrics\n\n\n- ✓ MLOps & Experiment Tracking - COULD BE DATA SCIENCE\n- ✓ Neural Reranking & Hybrid Retrieval - GOOD\n- ✓ Model Optimization (Quantization, Pruning) - GOOD\n- ✓ Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing - GOOD\n- ✓ ML Training Design (100+ Students, 4.8/5.0 rating) - SHOULD BE SEPARATE CATEGORY?\n- ✓ Research Implementation (Papers to Production) - GOOD\n\nI notice additional advanced AI skills that demonstrate deep technical expertise. The skills span MLOps, model optimization, and practical AI implementation. Particularly impressive are the training design credentials and research translation capabilities. The metrics around student training (100+ students, 4.8/5.0 rating) showcase exceptional instructional and technical skills.\n\nThe next set of skills emphasizes safety and cross-cultural communication, which are critical in modern technical environments. Safety-first approaches and effective communication bridge technical and interpersonal domains, ensuring responsible AI development and global collaboration.\n\nKey observations reveal significant gaps in skill categorization. AI-specific technical skills are dispersed across columns, creating potential misalignment. Critical emerging technologies like custom tokenization, model architecture design, and advanced optimization techniques are currently underrepresented.\n\nStrategic skill mapping highlights important contextual considerations. Medical device expertise and embedded systems skills represent valuable differentiators, especially for specialized AI roles requiring deep technical and regulatory understanding. The current skill taxonomy lacks comprehensive integration of leadership, educational, and domain-specific technical competencies.\n\nThe proposed approach involves restructuring skills to create more coherent categories that capture the nuanced landscape of AI technical expertise. Consolidating scattered teaching and training skills into a \"Technical Leadership\" category could provide clearer professional positioning.\n\nKey strategic questions center on optimal skill representation: balancing breadth of technical capabilities with depth in emerging AI technologies, and ensuring alignment with evolving industry requirements for AI governance, medical AI, and regulatory compliance roles.",

The system preserves sophisticated conditional logic from LaTeX systems while providing the visual appeal of François Quellec's design. It builds 5 different CV versions: Firmware, AI, Consulting, Executive, and General.\n\n## Core Commands\n\n### Building CVs\n- `python build_system.py all` - Build all CV versions (markdown only)\n- `python build_system.py firmware` - Build specific version (firmware/ai/consulting/executive/general)\n- `python scripts/build-cv.py all` - Alternative build script location\n\n### HTML Generation\n- `python build_system.py --html all` - Generate HTML for all versions\n- `python build_system.py --html firmware` - Generate HTML for specific version\n\n### PDF Generation\n- `python build_system.py --pdf all` - Generate PDF for all versions (tries automated then manual)\n- `python build_system.py --pdf firmware` - Generate PDF for specific version\n- `python build_system.py --all-formats firmware` - Build markdown, HTML, and PDF\n\n### Testing\n- `python test_system.py` - Run system tests\n- `python scripts/test-cv-system.py` - Alternative test script location\n- `python build_system.py --test firmware` - Test version logic without building\n\n### Setup\n- `bash setup_script.sh` - Initial project setup\n- `pip install pyyaml markdown` - Install dependencies\n- `brew install pandoc` - Install pandoc for HTML/PDF generation (macOS)\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Content System\n- **YAML Content Files** (`content/`): Personal info, skills, experience, projects, education\n- **Version Configuration**: 5 CV versions with different taglines, priorities, and content filters\n- **Conditional Logic**: Version-specific content using `versions` arrays and priority levels\n- **Priority System**: 1=core (all versions), 2=standard (not executive), 3=detailed (firmware/ai only)\n\n### Build System\n- **CVBuilder Class** (`build_system.py`): Core pro",

          "thinking": "Looking at these documents, I can now see the current state of Arthur's CV system much more clearly:\n\n## Current Issues I Can Identify:\n\n### 1. **Skills Section Problems in HTML Version:**\n\nLooking at the HTML version, the skills are in a 3-column table format:\n- **Software Engineering** | **AI & LLMs** | **Data Science**\n\n**Major Issues:**\n1. **Duplications**: \"PyTorch\" appears twice in Software Engineering column\n2. **Misplaced Skills**: Many AI-specific skills are in the \"Software Engineering\" column:\n   - \"Transformers (Built from scratch)\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Constitutional AI & Safety\" should be in AI column\n   - \"MLOps (MLflow, experiment tracking)\" should be in Data Science column\n   - \"Multimodal Systems (CLIP, ViT)\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Vector Databases (FAISS, BM25)\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Neural Reranking\" should be in AI column\n   - \"Mixed Precision Training\" should be in AI column\n\n3. **Cross-category Content**: Some skills appear in AI column that could be in other columns:\n   - \"ML Training Design (100+ Students, 4.8/5.0 rating)\" - could be separate category\n   - \"Cross-cultural Technical Communication\" - appears in both AI and Data Science columns\n\n### 2. **Build System Architecture:**\n\nFrom the `build_system.py` file, I can see this is actually a **markdown-based system**, not LaTeX! The system:\n- Uses YAML content files\n- Generates markdown\n- Converts to HTML/PDF via pandoc\n- Has conditional logic for different versions\n\nThis is different from what Arthur mentioned in his prompt about LaTeX system. The system uses:\n- `arthur-skills.yaml` for skills configuration\n- Version-specific filtering based on `versions` arrays\n\n\n- Priority system helps categorize skills into core, standard, and detailed levels\n\n### 3. **Missing LaTeX System:**\n\nFrom `cv.tex`, I can see there IS a LaTeX system, but the current HTML output seems to be from the markdown system. The LaTeX system has:\n- `\\def\\cvversion{ai}` - setting AI version\n- Conditional compilation with toggles\n- `sections/section_skills.tex` file\n\nI'll need to investigate which system takes precedence and how the priority levels interact with skill categorization.\n\nThe markdown system and LaTeX system appear to have different approaches to skill representation. I want to understand how these systems can be harmonized to create a comprehensive skills overview that captures Arthur's advanced AI technologies and expertise levels.\n\nThe skills configuration reveals significant gaps in the current representation, particularly around cutting-edge AI frameworks and methodologies that demonstrate deep technical expertise.\n\nImmediate focus will be on reorganizing the skills table to more accurately reflect the depth and breadth of technical capabilities, emphasizing core AI/ML technologies and specialized frameworks.\n\nThe proposed restructuring involves:\n- Consolidating redundant entries\n- Creating more precise categorical columns\n- Highlighting unique technical achievements\n- Removing duplicate skill listings\n- Elevating advanced AI methodologies to prominent positions\n\nSpecific improvements target creating a clear, non-repetitive skills narrative that showcases Arthur's sophisticated technical proficiency across AI development, safety, and production implementation.\n\nI'll need Arthur's confirmation on the proposed system architecture and column refinements before finalizing the organizational strategy.",

Fixes the YAML structure\n2. Reorganizes categories logically\n3. Adds missing cutting-edge technologies\n4. Properly positions medical device expertise\n5. Ensures version-specific content is optimizedPerfect! Now I can provide comprehensive skills optimization. I can see several critical issues with the current YAML structure.\n\n## Current Problems Analysis\n\n### 1. **Structural Issues**\n- YAML file appears incomplete (cuts off mid-section)\n- Inconsistent skill organization across versions\n- Missing many advanced technologies from your projects\n\n### 2. **AI Version Strategic Problems**\n- PyTorch duplication in different formats\n- Advanced AI technologies scattered incorrectly\n- Missing cutting-edge techniques you actually use\n\n### 3. **Missing Technologies from Your Projects**\nBased on your RAG and MultiModal projects, you're missing:\n- Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation\n- Custom Transformer architectures (5,000+ lines)\n- Neural reranking with hybrid retrieval\n- Research-to-production pipelines\n- Red teaming & adversarial testing\n\n## Optimized Skills Structure\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n",

Let me analyze the issues:\n\n**Current Problems in YAML Structure:**\n\n1. **Structure Issues**: The YAML seems incomplete - it cuts off mid-section\n2. **Column Organization**: The current 3-column approach has some logical issues:\n   - Column 1: Programming Languages\n   - Column 2: Core Technologies  \n   - Column 3: Domain Expertise\n   \n3. **AI Version Issues**:\n   - PyTorch is listed twice in different ways\n   - Advanced AI technologies are mixed across columns incorrectly\n   - Missing many advanced techniques Arthur actually uses\n\n4. **Medical Device Positioning**: Currently excluded from consulting but present in other versions\n\nLet me create a comprehensive optimization plan.\n\n**Ideal 3-Column Structure for AI Version:**\n- **Column 1: Software Engineering** (Languages, Core Programming)\n- **Column 2: AI & LLMs** (AI-specific technologies, models, frameworks)  \n- **Column 3: Data Science** (MLOps, deployment, tools, methodologies)\n\nThis matches the HTML table headers Arthur showed me and makes logical sense.\n\n**Key Technologies Missing from Arthur's Projects:**\nFrom his RAG and MultiModal projects, I can see he's using:\n- Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation\n- Custom Transformer implementations (5,000+ lines)\n- Neural reranking with hybrid retrieval\n- Mixed precision training\n- Apple Silicon MPS optimization\n- Red teaming & adversarial testing\n- MLflow & experiment tracking\n- Research-to-production pipelines\n\nI should create a comprehensive optimization that:\n1. Fixes the YAML structure\n2. Reorganizes categories logically\n3. Adds missing cutting-edge technologies\n4. Properly positions medical device expertise\n5. Ensures version-specific content is optimized",

It builds 5 different CV versions: Firmware, AI, Consulting, Executive, and General.\n\n## Core Commands\n\n### Building CVs\n- `python build_system.py all` - Build all CV versions (markdown only)\n- `python build_system.py firmware` - Build specific version (firmware/ai/consulting/executive/general)\n- `python scripts/build-cv.py all` - Alternative build script location\n\n### HTML Generation\n- `python build_system.py --html all` - Generate HTML for all versions\n- `python build_system.py --html firmware` - Generate HTML for specific version\n\n### PDF Generation\n- `python build_system.py --pdf all` - Generate PDF for all versions (tries automated then manual)\n- `python build_system.py --pdf firmware` - Generate PDF for specific version\n- `python build_system.py --all-formats firmware` - Build markdown, HTML, and PDF\n\n### Testing\n- `python test_system.py` - Run system tests\n- `python scripts/test-cv-system.py` - Alternative test script location\n- `python build_system.py --test firmware` - Test version logic without building\n\n### Setup\n- `bash setup_script.sh` - Initial project setup\n- `pip install pyyaml markdown` - Install dependencies\n- `brew install pandoc` - Install pandoc for HTML/PDF generation (macOS)\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Content System\n- **YAML Content Files** (`content/`): Personal info, skills, experience, projects, education\n- **Version Configuration**: 5 CV versions with different taglines, priorities, and content filters\n- **Conditional Logic**: Version-specific content using `versions` arrays and priority levels\n- **Priority System**: 1=core (all versions), 2=standard (not executive), 3=detailed (firmware/ai only)\n\n### Build System\n- **CVBuilder Class** (`build_system.py`): Core pro",
