3. **AI & ML Expertise** (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, RAG Systems, FAISS, etc.)
4. **Technical Education** (100+ Students trained)
5. **Medical Device Development** (still appears via `\whennotrole{consulting}`)
6. **Development Tools & Platforms**
7. **Project Management & Communication**

### Key Gap Analysis
From reviewing Arthur's recent projects (Technical Documentation RAG, MultiModal Insight Engine), I notice several cutting-edge AI technologies he's using that aren't fully represented in the current skills:

**Missing AI Technologies:**
- Constitutional AI / AI Safety frameworks
- MLflow / MLOps platforms  
- Mixed precision training

### Critical Questions Before Optimization

1. **Current AI Version Compilation**: The LaTeX shows `\def\cvversion{ai}` but the PDF provided appears to be the firmware version. Do you have a recent compilation of the AI version to see how skills currently appear?

2. **Medical Device Positioning**: The current logic shows Medical Device Development in the AI version (via `\whennotrole{consulting}`). Should this be:
   - Removed entirely from AI version?
   - Reframed as "AI Governance/Regulatory Expertise"? 
   - Kept but moved lower in priority?

3. **Skills Priority Order**: For the AI version, should the category order be:
   - AI & ML Expertise FIRST (before Programming Languages)?
   - Or keep current structure but enhance AI categories?

4. **Target Role Alignment**: Are you targeting:
   - Pure ML Engineer roles?
   - Applied AI/Production ML roles?
   - AI Safety/Governance positions?
   - Technical consulting with AI focus?

This affects which technologies to emphasize most prominently.

**Before I proceed with optimization, could you clarify these points?** I want to ensure the improvements address the specific positioning challenges you're seeing rather than making assumptions about the optimal structure.

--------------------------------------------------
Here it is, but I know I need to change some things, I have unapplied recommendations (focused on the layout for now)

[6] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T12:23:36
--------------------------------------------------
Now I can see the actual AI version of Arthur's CV in HTML format. This is incredibly helpful to see the current state. Let me analyze what I'm seeing:

## Current Skills Section Analysis

Looking at the current skills table in the AI version, I can see it's structured as a 3-column table:
1. **Software Engineering** (left column)
2. **AI & LLMs** (middle column) 
3. **Data Science** (right column)

### Current Content Analysis:

**Software Engineering Column:**
- âœ“ Python (Expert, 5+ years) - GOOD positioning
- âœ“ PyTorch (Custom architectures) - GOOD
- âœ“ TensorFlow/Keras
- âœ“ JAX (Functional transformers) - ADVANCED
- âœ“ JavaScript
- âœ“ SQL
- âœ“ PyTorch (Advanced, 3+ years) - DUPLICATED!
- âœ“ Transformers (Built from scratch) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN
- âœ“ Constitutional AI & Safety - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN  
- âœ“ MLOps (MLflow, experiment tracking) - SHOULD BE IN DATA SCIENCE
- âœ“ Multimodal Systems (CLIP, ViT) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN
- âœ“ Vector Databases (FAISS, BM25) - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN
- âœ“ Neural Reranking - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN
- âœ“ Mixed Precision Training - SHOULD BE IN AI COLUMN

**AI & LLMs Column:**
- âœ“ Transformer Architectures (Custom implementation) - GOOD
- âœ“ Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation - GOOD
- âœ“ Multimodal AI (Vision-Language Models) - GOOD
- âœ“ Production RAG Systems (99.5% accuracy) - EXCELLENT with metrics


- âœ“ MLOps & Experiment Tracking - COULD BE DATA SCIENCE
- âœ“ Neural Reranking & Hybrid Retrieval - GOOD
- âœ“ Model Optimization (Quantization, Pruning) - GOOD
- âœ“ Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing - GOOD
- âœ“ ML Training Design (100+ Students, 4.8/5.0 rating) - SHOULD BE SEPARATE CATEGORY?
- âœ“ Research Implementation (Papers to Production) - GOOD

I notice additional advanced AI skills that demonstrate deep technical expertise. The skills span MLOps, model optimization, and practical AI implementation. Particularly impressive are the training design credentials and research translation capabilities. The metrics around student training (100+ students, 4.8/5.0 rating) showcase exceptional instructional and technical skills.

The next set of skills emphasizes safety and cross-cultural communication, which are critical in modern technical environments. Safety-first approaches and effective communication bridge technical and interpersonal domains, ensuring responsible AI development and global collaboration.

Key observations reveal significant gaps in skill categorization. AI-specific technical skills are dispersed across columns, creating potential misalignment. Critical emerging technologies like custom tokenization, model architecture design, and advanced optimization techniques are currently underrepresented.

Strategic skill mapping highlights important contextual considerations. Medical device expertise and embedded systems skills represent valuable differentiators, especially for specialized AI roles requiring deep technical and regulatory understanding. The current skill taxonomy lacks comprehensive integration of leadership, educational, and domain-specific technical competencies.

The proposed approach involves restructuring skills to create more coherent categories that capture the nuanced landscape of AI technical expertise. Consolidating scattered teaching and training skills into a "Technical Leadership" category could provide clearer professional positioning.

Key strategic questions center on optimal skill representation: balancing breadth of technical capabilities with depth in emerging AI technologies, and ensuring alignment with evolving industry requirements for AI governance, medical AI, and regulatory compliance roles.Perfect! Now I can see the current AI version state. Let me analyze the skills section systematically.

Looking at these documents, I can now see the current state of Arthur's CV system much more clearly:

## Current Issues I Can Identify:

### 1. **Skills Section Problems in HTML Version:**

Looking at the HTML version, the skills are in a 3-column table format:
- **Software Engineering** | **AI & LLMs** | **Data Science**

**Major Issues:**
1. **Duplications**: "PyTorch" appears twice in Software Engineering column
2. **Misplaced Skills**: Many AI-specific skills are in the "Software Engineering" column:
   - "Transformers (Built from scratch)" should be in AI column
   - "Constitutional AI & Safety" should be in AI column
   - "MLOps (MLflow, experiment tracking)" should be in Data Science column
   - "Multimodal Systems (CLIP, ViT)" should be in AI column
   - "Vector Databases (FAISS, BM25)" should be in AI column
   - "Neural Reranking" should be in AI column
   - "Mixed Precision Training" should be in AI column

3. **Cross-category Content**: Some skills appear in AI column that could be in other columns:
   - "ML Training Design (100+ Students, 4.8/5.0 rating)" - could be separate category
   - "Cross-cultural Technical Communication" - appears in both AI and Data Science columns

### 2. **Build System Architecture:**

From the `build_system.py` file, I can see this is actually a **markdown-based system**, not LaTeX! The system:
- Uses YAML content files
- Generates markdown
- Converts to HTML/PDF via pandoc
- Has conditional logic for different versions

This is different from what Arthur mentioned in his prompt about LaTeX system. The system uses:
- `arthur-skills.yaml` for skills configuration
- Version-specific filtering based on `versions` arrays


- Priority system helps categorize skills into core, standard, and detailed levels

### 3. **Missing LaTeX System:**

From `cv.tex`, I can see there IS a LaTeX system, but the current HTML output seems to be from the markdown system. The LaTeX system has:
- `\def\cvversion{ai}` - setting AI version
- Conditional compilation with toggles
- `sections/section_skills.tex` file

I'll need to investigate which system takes precedence and how the priority levels interact with skill categorization.

The markdown system and LaTeX system appear to have different approaches to skill representation. I want to understand how these systems can be harmonized to create a comprehensive skills overview that captures Arthur's advanced AI technologies and expertise levels.

The skills configuration reveals significant gaps in the current representation, particularly around cutting-edge AI frameworks and methodologies that demonstrate deep technical expertise.

Immediate focus will be on reorganizing the skills table to more accurately reflect the depth and breadth of technical capabilities, emphasizing core AI/ML technologies and specialized frameworks.

The proposed restructuring involves:
- Consolidating redundant entries
- Creating more precise categorical columns
- Highlighting unique technical achievements
- Removing duplicate skill listings
- Elevating advanced AI methodologies to prominent positions

Specific improvements target creating a clear, non-repetitive skills narrative that showcases Arthur's sophisticated technical proficiency across AI development, safety, and production implementation.

I'll need Arthur's confirmation on the proposed system architecture and column refinements before finalizing the organizational strategy.Excellent! Now I can see the current state clearly. I notice something important - you have **two different CV systems**:

1. **Markdown/YAML System** (`build_system.py` + YAML files)
2. **LaTeX System** (`cv.tex` + sections/section_skills.tex)

## Critical Clarification Needed

**Which system generated the HTML version you showed me?** This affects my optimization approach:

- If it's from the **markdown system**: I'll need to modify `arthur-skills.yaml`
- If it's from the **LaTeX system**: I'll need to modify `sections/section_skills.tex`

## Skills Section Issues I Can See

Looking at your current HTML skills table, I identify these major problems:

### 1. **Structural Issues**
- **PyTorch duplication**: Listed twice in Software Engineering column
- **Category misplacement**: AI skills scattered across wrong columns
- **Missing cutting-edge tech**: From your projects, you're using advanced techniques not listed

### 2. **Strategic Positioning Problem**
The table headers suggest:
- **Software Engineering** | **AI & LLMs** | **Data Science**

But AI-specific skills are mixed throughout, diluting the AI positioning.

### 3. **Missing Technologies from Your Projects**
Based on your RAG and MultiModal projects, you're missing:
- Custom tokenization & model architecture
- Safety evaluation frameworks  
- Advanced optimization techniques
- Research-to-production pipelines

## Before I Provide Detailed Recommendations

**Please clarify:**

1. **Primary System**: Which system should I focus on - the markdown/YAML system or LaTeX system?

2. **HTML Source**: Was the HTML version generated from markdown system or LaTeX system?

3. **Medical Device Positioning**: Should medical device/regulatory expertise be:
   - Completely removed from AI version?
   - Reframed as "AI Governance/Safety" expertise?
   - Kept but deprioritized?

4. **Table Structure Preference**: Do you want to keep the 3-column format or explore alternatives?

Once I know which system to target, I can provide specific file modifications and optimization recommendations.

[7] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T12:26:29
--------------------------------------------------
1. YAML system
2. Markdown
3. Kept but deprioritized (I'm afraid my profile might seem a little off if I remove it completely)
4. I like the 3 columns but I'm open to alternative (I like vertical better than horizontal for the "skills type" though

[8] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T12:27:30
--------------------------------------------------
Perfect! Now I have clarity:

1. Focus on YAML system (not LaTeX)
2. HTML was generated from markdown
3. Keep medical device but deprioritize in AI version
4. 3-column format is preferred, but open to alternatives with vertical orientation for skill types

Let me search for the current skills YAML file to understand the structure.Perfect! Now I can provide targeted recommendations. Let me examine the current YAML skills structure.
```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.
```

Perfect! Now I can see the current `arthur-skills.yaml` structure. Let me analyze the issues:

**Current Problems in YAML Structure:**

1. **Structure Issues**: The YAML seems incomplete - it cuts off mid-section
2. **Column Organization**: The current 3-column approach has some logical issues:
   - Column 1: Programming Languages
   - Column 2: Core Technologies  
   - Column 3: Domain Expertise
   
3. **AI Version Issues**:
   - PyTorch is listed twice in different ways
   - Advanced AI technologies are mixed across columns incorrectly
   - Missing many advanced techniques Arthur actually uses

4. **Medical Device Positioning**: Currently excluded from consulting but present in other versions

Let me create a comprehensive optimization plan.

**Ideal 3-Column Structure for AI Version:**
- **Column 1: Software Engineering** (Languages, Core Programming)
- **Column 2: AI & LLMs** (AI-specific technologies, models, frameworks)  
- **Column 3: Data Science** (MLOps, deployment, tools, methodologies)

This matches the HTML table headers Arthur showed me and makes logical sense.

**Key Technologies Missing from Arthur's Projects:**
From his RAG and MultiModal projects, I can see he's using:
- Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation
- Custom Transformer implementations (5,000+ lines)
- Neural reranking with hybrid retrieval
- Mixed precision training
- Apple Silicon MPS optimization
- Red teaming & adversarial testing
- MLflow & experiment tracking
- Research-to-production pipelines

I should create a comprehensive optimization that:
1. Fixes the YAML structure
2. Reorganizes categories logically
3. Adds missing cutting-edge technologies
4. Properly positions medical device expertise
5. Ensures version-specific content is optimizedPerfect! Now I can provide comprehensive skills optimization. I can see several critical issues with the current YAML structure.

## Current Problems Analysis

### 1. **Structural Issues**
- YAML file appears incomplete (cuts off mid-section)
- Inconsistent skill organization across versions
- Missing many advanced technologies from your projects

### 2. **AI Version Strategic Problems**
- PyTorch duplication in different formats
- Advanced AI technologies scattered incorrectly
- Missing cutting-edge techniques you actually use

### 3. **Missing Technologies from Your Projects**
Based on your RAG and MultiModal projects, you're missing:
- Constitutional AI & Safety Evaluation
- Custom Transformer architectures (5,000+ lines)
- Neural reranking with hybrid retrieval
- Research-to-production pipelines
- Red teaming & adversarial testing

[9] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T12:28:53
--------------------------------------------------
Let me apply the recommendation I mentioned before you suggest anything, let's focus on the other impending tasks for my applications

[10] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T12:29:04
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants to apply the optimization recommendations I provided to their skills section first, before we discuss other application tasks. They're being strategic about completing one task before moving to the next. 

I should acknowledge this approach and let them know I'm ready to help with the next tasks once they've implemented the skills optimization. I should also ask what the other impending application tasks are so I can be prepared to help efficiently.Absolutely! That's the right approach - implement the skills optimization first, then move systematically through the other application tasks.

**While you apply the skills recommendations**, could you let me know what the **other impending application tasks** are so I can prepare to help efficiently? 

Based on your initial prompt, I suspect they might include:

ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Application Tasks:**
- Final CV validation (all 5 versions compile correctly)
- Job application templates (role-specific cover letters)
- Target company research (Swiss/European AI companies)
- Interview preparation frameworks
- Portfolio/GitHub optimization

ðŸŽ¯ **Or more specific to current applications:**
- Specific job descriptions you're targeting
- Company-specific CV customizations
- Application deadline priorities

**Let me know your priority order** and I'll be ready to jump into the next task as soon as you've updated the skills section. This way we can maintain momentum and get you application-ready efficiently.

I'm standing by to help with whatever is most time-sensitive for your job applications!

[11] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T13:37:03
--------------------------------------------------
Help me start the next step.

[12] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T13:37:13
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants to move to the next step after implementing the skills optimization. Looking back at their initial prompt, the next logical steps after skills optimization would be:

From their initial prompt, they mentioned:
- Skills Section Optimization (PRIORITY) - they're working on this now
- Final CV versions testing and validation  
- Job application strategy development

So the next step would likely be "Final CV validation" - making sure all 5 versions compile correctly and are ready for applications.

Let me help them systematically validate the CV system and then move into application strategy.Perfect! Let's move to **Final CV Validation** - ensuring all 5 versions compile correctly and are application-ready.

## Step 2: Final CV System Validation

Let me help you systematically test and validate your CV system before moving to application strategy.

Great! I can see the user has a comprehensive CV

[13] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T13:37:46
--------------------------------------------------
Help me start the next step. I'm working on the resume on the side, consider it done for now, we'll do a final validation right before submitting the applications

[14] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T13:38:04
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants to move to the next step in their application process. From their initial prompt, the next priorities after skills optimization were:

**Post-Skills Optimization Tasks**:
1. **Final CV validation**: Test all 5 versions compile correctly
2. **Job application templates**: Role-specific cover letter frameworks
3. **Target company analysis**: Switzerland/Europe AI companies research
4. **Interview preparation**: Technical questions for AI/ML transitions
5. **Portfolio presentation**: GitHub projects optimization for applications

Since they said "consider it done for now" regarding the resume/skills section, and they want to do final validation "right before submitting applications", the logical next step would be either:
- Job application templates 
- Target company research
- Portfolio optimization

Given they mentioned "impending tasks for my applications" which sounds urgent, I should ask what's most time-sensitive or what they want to focus on next. But since they said "Help me start the next step", I should be more proactive and suggest what makes most sense strategically.

For someone in AI/ML job search, the most logical next step would be either:
1. Target company research (to know where to apply)
2. Job application templates (to be ready when good positions come up)
3. Portfolio optimization (to have strong supporting materials)

Given Arthur's location in Lausanne and focus on Swiss/European market, company research might be most valuable to start with, as it informs everything else.

Let me ask for clarification but also offer a structured approach.Perfect! Let's move to the next critical application task. Based on your situation, I see a few strategic next steps:

## **Next Step Options:**

**ðŸŽ¯ Option A: Target Company Research**
- Swiss/European AI companies analysis
- Role requirements mapping
- Salary benchmarking for Lausanne market
- Contact identification (recruiters, hiring managers)

**ðŸŽ¯ Option B: Job Application Templates** 
- Role-specific cover letter frameworks
- Email templates for recruiter outreach
- Follow-up sequence templates
- Application tracking system

**ðŸŽ¯ Option C: Portfolio/GitHub Optimization**
- Project presentation for applications
- README optimization for recruiters
- Demo links and documentation
- Technical showcase preparation

## **My Recommendation:**

I'd suggest starting with **Target Company Research** because:
- It informs all other application materials
- Swiss AI market is specialized - good intel is valuable
- Better to apply strategically than spray-and-pray
- Your embeddedâ†’AI transition story needs the right audience

## **What's Most Urgent?**

**Which would be most valuable for your immediate application timeline:**
1. **Companies to target** (research first)
2. **Applications ready to send** (templates first) 
3. **Portfolio polished** (GitHub optimization first)
4. **Something else** (specific deadline/opportunity?)

Let me know your preference and I'll dive deep into structured, actionable guidance for whichever path is most time-sensitive!
