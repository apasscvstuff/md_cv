## Content Extraction Results

### **Two-Phase Extraction Process Applied**

#### **PHASE 1: COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION (No Filtering)**
Extract ALL user and assistant statements from the conversation and artifacts, including:
- Direct factual claims about background/experience
- Procedural requests that contain strategic context
- Questions that reveal professional thinking
- Corrections and clarifications
- Decision-making processes
- Professional philosophy statements
- Any statement that reveals something about the user's approach, values, or professional identity

**DO NOT FILTER DURING EXTRACTION** - Capture everything first.

#### **PHASE 2: RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT (Post-Extraction)**
After complete extraction, use the `strategic_content_identification_guide.md` to assess which statements represent:

**FACTUAL CLAIMS about the user's:**
- Professional background and experience
- Technical skills and capabilities  
- Project achievements and outcomes
- Educational credentials
- Quantifiable metrics and results

**STRATEGIC CONTENT about the user's:**
- Career positioning decisions and rationale
- Professional development strategies and philosophy
- Application and job search approaches
- Strategic insights about career direction
- User corrections that reveal professional standards
- Decision-making processes and reasoning
- Professional values and constraints
- Quality control and authenticity concerns

**STRATEGIC CONTENT TESTS:**
Apply these tests from `strategic_content_identification_guide.md` before excluding any user statement:
- The "WHY" Test: Does it reveal WHY they want something, not just WHAT?
- The "PROFESSIONAL INSIGHT" Test: Does it reveal professional approach, values, or strategic thinking?
- The "DECISION PROCESS" Test: Does it show professional decision-making or criteria?

**When in doubt, INCLUDE and mark as PENDING for user review.**

## Classification Matrix Integration

### **Truth Base Application**
**Pre-Analysis Setup:**
- [ ] Load current `statement_classification_matrix.csv` 
- [ ] Read User_Category column for corrections (overrides Category column)
- [ ] Filter User_Reviewed=YES items as authoritative truth base
- [ ] Apply corrected classification rules to new analysis

### **Classification Process - ALL MEANINGFUL CLAIMS ADDED**
For each new claim identified:
1. **Check existing CSV** for similar claims and user corrections
2. **Apply truth base hierarchy** (User_Category > Career assessment > Cross-reference)
3. **Use updated detection rules** based on user feedback patterns
4. **Assign new ID** (Format: [Conv##]_[###]) and add as row to CSV
5. **CRITICAL: ADD ALL MEANINGFUL CLAIMS** regardless of accuracy level

**MEANINGFUL CONTENT SCOPE:** Extract statements representing:
- Substantive claims about user's professional profile
- Strategic discussions about career positioning and decisions  
- Professional insights and strategic thinking revealed
- User corrections and clarifications of professional approach
- Decision-making processes and rationale
- Professional philosophy and quality standards
- Exclude only: Pure procedural requests with no strategic context, basic task instructions

### **CSV Updates for This Conversation**
**New rows added to statement_classification_matrix.csv:**

```csv
ID,Statement,Source,Category,User_Category,User_Reviewed,Evidence_Reference,User_Notes,Last_Updated
[NEW_ID],[New claim found],Conv [##],[ACCURATE/EMBELLISHMENT/FABRICATION/PENDING],,NO,[Evidence],[],2025-07-24
```

**Classification Requirements:**
- **ACCURATE claims**: Add to build positive truth base and track verified information
- **EMBELLISHMENT/FABRICATION claims**: Add to identify and prevent future errors
- **PENDING claims**: Add when classification is uncertain and requires user review

### **Truth Source Cross-Reference**

#### **User-Corrected Truth Base** (Highest Authority)
Reference to CSV rows where User_Reviewed=YES:
- Load from statement_classification_matrix.csv
- User_Category column overrides original Category classification
- User_Notes provide context for similar new claims

#### **Career Assessment Verification** (High Authority)
| **User Claim** | **Career Assessment Match** | **Verification Status** |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| [User statement] | [Matching section/form] | ✅ Verified / ❌ Conflicted / ⚠️ Unclear |

#### **Cross-Conversation Consistency** (Medium Authority)
| **Claim** | **First Mention** | **Subsequent Mentions** | **Consistency** |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| [Specific claim] | Conv [##] | Conv [##], [##] | ✅ Consistent / ❌ Conflicted |
