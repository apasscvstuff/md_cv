The embedded background becomes a valuable differentiator, not the primary identity.\n\n---\n\n## **Systematic Review Approach**\n\nI recommend we optimize in this order:\n\n### **1. EXPERIENCE Section** (Most Critical)\n- Reposition Tandem role to emphasize AI/system architecture aspects\n- Elevate IMD teaching role as core AI/ML credential\n- Reframe ADEPT Neuro to highlight ML seizure detection\n- Position embedded work as AI systems foundation\n\n### **2. PROJECTS Section** \n- Lead with current AI projects (RAG, MultiModal)\n- Quantify technical achievements with specific metrics\n- Connect embedded projects to AI applications\n\n### **3. SKILLS Section**\n- Restructure to lead with AI/ML technologies\n- Position embedded skills as supporting competencies\n- Add specific AI frameworks and tools\n\nWould you like to start with the **EXPERIENCE section optimization**?
