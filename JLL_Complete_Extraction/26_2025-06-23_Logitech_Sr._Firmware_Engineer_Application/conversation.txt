[5] HUMAN - 2025-06-06T05:46:46
--------------------------------------------------
1. Unfortunately, my technical projects are from Tandem and not public.
2. Noted
3. I only got the Senior title as I was leaving this job, can I really put senior in my resume ?

[6] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-06T05:47:23
--------------------------------------------------
Good points from Arthur:

1. Technical projects from Tandem are not public - so we can't put GitHub links or make them sound like open source projects. We need to be careful about confidentiality and present them as professional work experience rather than public portfolio pieces.

2. The "Senior" title issue is important - if he only got the Senior title as he was leaving, we need to be careful about misrepresentation. However, looking at his work certificates, they do show he was performing senior-level responsibilities even if the title wasn't official until the end. We need to balance honesty with strategic positioning.

Let me look at his work certificates again:

From the 2024 certificate: "Technical Software subproject leader role", "Creates, maintains, and reviews software Architecture", "Mr. Passuello carries out the tasks entrusted to him to our full satisfaction. Thanks to his sense of responsibility and his management of priorities, he is able to organize his assigned tasks in an efficient, accurate and entirely reliable manner. His technical skills enable him to regularly exceed expectations"

From the 2025 certificate: "Role de leader technique dans les d√©veloppements de fonctionnalit√©s logicielles", "Arthur s'est vu offrir de g√©rer techniquement des sous projets logiciels", "Je recommande sans r√©serve Arthur comme leader technique"

So he was performing senior/lead responsibilities throughout, even if the title wasn't official until the end. This is a common situation - people often perform at a higher level before getting the official title.

For the resume, we have a few options:
1. Use "Embedded Software Engineer & Technical Project Lead" (which is accurate based on certificates)
2. Use "Embedded Software Engineer (Technical Lead)" 
3. Use "Senior Embedded Software Engineer" only for the final period when it was official

The most honest approach would be to show progression or use the technical lead title that was clearly established throughout his tenure.Excellent clarifications! Let me adjust the recommendations based on these important details:

## **1. üîí Confidential Projects Strategy**

You're absolutely right - Tandem projects are confidential and not public. Let's reframe:

### **Remove GitHub References**
- No GitHub link in header
- Projects section focuses on **learning/personal projects only**
- Tandem work stays in **Experience section** as professional accomplishments

### **Confidentiality-Appropriate Framing**
Instead of detailed technical specifics, use:
- "Proprietary embedded firmware platform"
- "Custom test infrastructure for medical device validation"
- "Regulatory-compliant embedded system architecture"

## **2. üéØ Title Accuracy Strategy**

You raise a crucial point about the "Senior" title. Let's be strategically honest:

### **Timeline-Accurate Approach**
```

[8] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-06T05:49:15
--------------------------------------------------
Arthur is absolutely right! Looking at his work certificates and career assessment documents, he definitely has demonstrated all of these core competencies from the Logitech job description. Let me review:

From his documents:
1. **Product roadmaps ‚Üí tech strategies**: His work on the FIH firmware, the double pump system architecture, and HIL bench shows he took requirements and turned them into technical solutions
2. **Multiple projects in parallel**: He managed FIH firmware, HIL development, double pump architecture, plus other responsibilities 
3. **Cross-functional leadership**: His certificates specifically mention coordinating with HW, QA, RA, clinical teams
4. **Communication skills**: Teaching at IMD, presenting to management, stakeholder demos
5. **External partners**: Working with suppliers and contractors mentioned in his certificates
6. **Independent critical thinking**: His autonomous management of projects, problem-solving (like the Bluetooth bug)
7. **English fluency**: Taught in English at IMD, international environment

The issue is that these competencies are somewhat "buried" in his current CV bullets and not explicitly highlighted to match Logitech's specific language. He's right that this could be better positioned either in the CV or cover letter.

Let me think about the best strategy:
- CV should show these competencies through specific examples
- Cover letter should explicitly connect his experience to Logitech's competency requirements
- Both should use similar language to what Logitech uses

This is a great catch by Arthur - he needs to make these competencies more visible and directly map to Logitech's requirements.**Excellent observation!** You absolutely DO have all those core competencies, but they're not sufficiently **visible and explicitly connected** to Logitech's language. Let me show you how to make this alignment crystal clear.
```

```

Arthur is absolutely right - he has demonstrated experience with all these competencies, but they need to be more explicitly highlighted and connected to Logitech's specific language. 

Looking at his work certificates and career assessment:
1. He managed the FIH firmware project from requirements to delivery - that's translating product roadmaps into tech strategies
2. He juggled multiple projects (FIH, HIL, double pump, etc.) - that's managing multiple priorities
3. His certificates specifically mention coordinating across HW, QA, RA, clinical teams, plus external contractors - that's cross-functional and distributed team leadership
4. He taught at IMD and presented to management - that's communication skills
5. He worked with suppliers and contractors - that's external partner influence
6. The Bluetooth bug resolution and autonomous project management show critical thinking
7. He taught in English and works in international environment - that's English fluency

The strategy should be:
1. **CV**: Add a "Core Competencies" section that directly mirrors Logitech's language with brief examples
2. **Cover letter**: Explicitly connect each competency to specific examples and directly reference Logitech's requirements

This will make it immediately obvious to recruiters/hiring managers that he meets all their core competency requirements.## **üí° Strategic Approach: Make Competencies Explicitly Visible**

You're absolutely right - you have **all** of these competencies, but they need to be **explicitly highlighted** using Logitech's exact language. Here's a two-pronged approach:

### **1. CV Enhancement: Add "Core Competencies" Section**

Insert this **right after** your Professional Summary:
