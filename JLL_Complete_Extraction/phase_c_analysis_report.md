## Classification Matrix Integration

### **Truth Base Application**
**Pre-Analysis Setup:**
- [x] Load current `statement_classification_matrix.csv` 
- [x] Read User_Category column for corrections (overrides Category column)
- [x] Filter User_Reviewed=YES items as authoritative truth base
- [x] Apply corrected classification rules to new analysis

### **Classification Process**
Applied user-corrected truth base patterns:
1. **Integrity emphasis**: User consistently corrects fabricated metrics and implementations
2. **Accuracy focus**: User provides specific numbers when available, admits when not quantifiable
3. **Scope clarification**: User distinguishes between design vs implementation, learning vs production
4. **Technical precision**: User corrects technical details with specificity

### **CSV Updates for This Phase**
**New rows added to statement_classification_matrix.csv:**

**From Conversation 14 (27 new entries C14_001 - C14_027):**
- User goals and optimization requests (ACCURATE)
- Specific quantified achievements at Tandem (ACCURATE)
- Technical implementation details (ACCURATE)
