## Classification Matrix Integration

### **Truth Base Application**
**Pre-Analysis Setup:**
- [x] Load current `statement_classification_matrix.csv` 
- [x] Read User_Category column for corrections (overrides Category column)
- [x] Filter User_Reviewed=YES items as authoritative truth base
- [x] Apply corrected classification rules to new analysis

### **Classification Process**
For each new claim identified:
1. **Check existing CSV** ✅ Applied user corrections from WE008 (team size inflation), WE007 (LLM fabrication)
2. **Apply truth base hierarchy** ✅ User corrections took precedence over assistant analysis
3. **Use updated detection rules** ✅ Conservative approach for uncertain metrics
4. **Assign new ID** ✅ Added PA001-PA007 series for Phase A findings

### **CSV Updates for This Phase**
**New rows added to statement_classification_matrix.csv:**

```csv

```

### **Truth Source Cross-Reference**

#### **User-Corrected Truth Base** (Highest Authority)
Applied corrections from CSV rows where User_Reviewed=YES:
- **WE008**: Team training size corrected from "15+ engineers" to "~5 consultants" 
- **WE007**: LLM deployment at Tandem corrected as fabrication
- **WE005**: 99.9% uptime SLA confirmed as fabrication
- **All QM*** items**: Performance metrics confirmed as fabricated

#### **Career Assessment Verification** (High Authority)
| **User Claim** | **Career Assessment Match** | **Verification Status** |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2.5 years medical device experience | Form 4 employment timeline | ✅ Verified |
| RAG system work at Tandem | No direct match, user confirmed | ✅ User-verified |
| IMD curriculum design role | Form 2 teaching experience | ✅ Verified |

#### **Cross-Conversation Consistency** (Medium Authority)
| **Claim** | **First Mention** | **Subsequent Mentions** | **Consistency** |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| AI fabrication problem | Conv 03 | Conv 04 extensive analysis | ✅ Consistent |
| Resume accuracy issues | Conv 04 | Artifact correction prompts | ✅ Consistent |
| RAG system at Tandem | Conv 04 correction | User direct confirmation | ✅ Consistent |

### **Enhanced Categorized Findings**

#### **✅ ACCURATE Claims** (User-verified or strongly evidenced)
- **"Claude invents achievements/metrics for resume"** (Matrix ID: PA001)
  - **Source:** Conv 03, Message 1
  - **Truth Base Status:** User-verified critical problem identification
  - **Evidence:** Direct user statement with emphasis on severity
  - **Matrix Notes:** Core issue driving need for validation framework

- **"RAG system work at Tandem was legitimate"** (Matrix ID: PA006)  
  - **Source:** Conv 04, Message 13
  - **Truth Base Status:** User-corrected from omission
  - **Evidence:** User direct correction when assistant omitted this work
  - **Matrix Notes:** Important correction showing RAG work was real professional experience

- **"IMD role included curriculum design and auditorium lectures"** (Matrix ID: PA007)
  - **Source:** Conv 04, Message 14  
  - **Truth Base Status:** User-corrected from undervaluation
  - **Evidence:** User detailed correction of teaching responsibilities
  - **Matrix Notes:** Shows IMD role was more substantial than initially characterized

#### **⚠️ EMBELLISHED Claims** (User-corrected or detected pattern)
*No new embellishments identified in Phase A - most fabrications were already documented in truth base*

#### **❌ FABRICATED Claims** (Clear invention, user-confirmed safe to mark)
*Phase A conversations focused on identifying and correcting existing fabrications rather than generating new ones. All major fabrications (ML deployment, performance metrics, team sizes) were already documented in the truth base from previous analysis.*

#### **🔄 PENDING Claims** (Require user review before classification)
- **"96% test coverage achieved in HIL system"** (Matrix ID: PA004)
  - **Source:** Conv 04, Assistant response + Artifacts
  - **Uncertainty Reason:** Metric referenced in correction artifacts but not explicitly confirmed by user
  - **Similar Matrix Items:** QM005 (96% test coverage) marked as EMBELLISHMENT by user
  - **Review Priority:** Medium - may be same metric as previously corrected item

---

## Actionable Insights

### **Verified Information for Resume/Applications**
- **RAG System Professional Experience**: User confirmed this was legitimate work at Tandem, not just personal project - valuable for AI role applications
- **IMD Curriculum Design Leadership**: User confirmed substantial teaching role with full curriculum responsibility - strengthens educational leadership positioning  
- **Job Application Readiness**: User has saved multiple job offers and is ready to begin applications with coaching support

### **Profile Clarifications Needed**
- **HIL Test Coverage Metric**: Verify if 96% test coverage claim is accurate or matches previously corrected fabrication (QM005)
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Confirm final Tandem employment end date (February 2025 referenced in corrections)

### **Content Corrections Required**
- **Resume Fabrication Cleanup**: Extensive fabrications identified and correction protocols developed in artifacts
- **Balanced Assessment Training**: Need for anti-fabrication controls and realistic-but-supportive tone established
- **Systematic Correction Process**: Comprehensive correction prompts created for addressing fabricated content

---

## Risk Assessment

### **High-Risk Fabrications** (Potential resume fraud)
*No new high-risk fabrications identified in Phase A - focus was on correction protocols*

### **Medium-Risk Embellishments** (Could be questioned in interviews)  
- **HIL Test Coverage Metric**: May duplicate previously corrected fabrication

### **Low-Risk Inconsistencies** (Minor corrections needed)
- **Timeline Precision**: End date specification for Tandem employment

---

## User Review Items

### **For Confirmation**
- [ ] Verify 96% test coverage claim for HIL system (may be duplicate of corrected QM005)
- [ ] Confirm final employment end date at Tandem (February 2025 referenced)

### **For Correction**
*Phase A identified existing fabrications rather than new ones - correction prompts have been created*

### **For Clarification**
- [ ] Review comprehensive correction prompts created in artifacts for accuracy and completeness
