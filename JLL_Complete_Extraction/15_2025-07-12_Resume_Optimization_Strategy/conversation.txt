Look at the resume reference attached (CV_REF). Compare it to my current CV (attached too) and the new structure of my resume on the github repo. Assess it's quality and define an approach to help systematically select content based on job offer analysis

--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking me to analyze Arthur's CV and provide an assessment of its quality compared to a reference CV, and to define an approach for systematically selecting content based on job offer analysis. Let me examine all the documents provided.

From what I can see:

1. Arthur's current CV (the PDF versions) - I can see two versions
2. A reference CV structure 
3. Various LaTeX template files for different sections
4. Arthur's comprehensive career assessment documents
5. Job offer analysis framework instructions

Let me analyze the current CV first:

**Arthur's Current CV Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- Clear technical expertise sections with good categorization
- Strong experience descriptions with quantifiable achievements
- Good project section with GitHub links and technical details
- Appropriate contact information and professional formatting
- Strong educational background (EPFL + HEIG-VD)

**Areas for improvement:**
- The headline/tagline could be more targeted depending on the specific role
- Experience bullets could be more results-oriented with specific metrics
- Projects section could better highlight business impact vs just technical implementation
- Technical expertise section is comprehensive but might be overwhelming
- Missing some modern AI/ML keywords that are trending in job descriptions

**Comparison to Reference Structure:**
Looking at the LaTeX files, I can see different template sections for:
- Different headlines (firmware-focused, general, AI consulting)
- Different skills sections (firmware, general, AI consulting)
- Different experience sections (firmware, general, AI consulting)
- Various other sections like projects, education, languages, etc.

This shows Arthur has already created a modular approach, which is excellent for customization.

**Quality Assessment:**
- Technical depth: Excellent
- Formatting: Professional
- Content organization: Good
- Targeting flexibility: Very good (multiple versions)
- ATS optimization: Could be improved
- Results quantification: Moderate

**Systematic Approach Needed:**
The user wants me to define an approach to systematically select content based on job offer analysis. This should integrate with the job offer analysis framework they provided earlier.


I'll develop a strategic mapping process that dynamically aligns CV content with specific job requirements. By creating a keyword matching and impact scoring system, I can help Arthur precisely tailor his modular CV templates to each unique job opportunity. The approach will involve extracting key competencies, technical skills, and achievement metrics from job descriptions, then cross-referencing them with his existing CV sections to optimize relevance and highlight the most compelling professional narrative.Looking at your CV materials, I can see you've already built an excellent modular system with multiple LaTeX templates. Let me assess the quality and define a systematic content selection approach.

## **CV Quality Assessment**

### **Strengths of Current CV:**
✅ **Modular Architecture**: Your LaTeX template system allows for targeted customization  
✅ **Technical Depth**: Comprehensive coverage of embedded systems, medical devices, and emerging AI/ML  
✅ **Quantified Achievements**: "First-In-Human trial compliance," "100+ MBA students," specific project grades  
✅ **Professional Formatting**: Clean, ATS-friendly layout with appropriate sections  
✅ **Relevant Project Portfolio**: GitHub links, technical depth, academic recognition scores  

### **Areas for Strategic Improvement:**
⚠️ **Results Quantification**: Need more business impact metrics (timeline reductions, cost savings, team sizes)  
⚠️ **Keyword Optimization**: Missing trending AI/ML terms that appear in current job descriptions  
⚠️ **Value Proposition**: Headlines could be more role-specific and value-focused  
⚠️ **Experience Hierarchy**: Some achievements buried in long bullet lists need better prioritization  

## **Systematic Content Selection Framework**

### **Phase 1: Job Offer Analysis → CV Mapping**

```
[Job Analysis] → [Content Selection] → [Version Assembly]
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Competency Gaps    Priority Content    Targeted CV Version
```

**Step 1: Competency-Driven Content Prioritization**
- **YES matches**: Feature prominently with specific achievement examples
- **PARTIAL matches**: Position transferable skills with context bridges  
- **NO matches**: Address through learning plans or omit if not critical

**Step 2: Experience Bullet Prioritization Matrix**
For each role, rank experience bullets by:
- Direct relevance to job requirements (1-5)
- Results impact/quantification (1-5)  
- Keyword density match (1-5)
- Uniqueness/differentiation (1-5)

### **Phase 2: Dynamic Content Selection Rules**

**Template Selection Logic:**
```
If (job_focus == "firmware/embedded") → use section_experience_fw.tex
If (job_focus == "AI/ML consulting") → use section_experience_cons_ai.tex  
If (job_focus == "general tech") → use section_experience_gen.tex
```

**Skills Section Optimization:**
- **Firmware roles**: Lead with embedded systems, medical device compliance
- **AI/ML roles**: Lead with machine learning, data science, Python ecosystem
- **Hybrid roles**: Balance both with role-weighted keyword density

**Headline Customization:**
- Extract 2-3 most critical job requirements
- Map to Arthur's strongest matching achievements
- Craft value proposition highlighting those intersections

### **Phase 3: Content Selection Decision Tree**

**For Experience Bullets:**
```
Is this directly mentioned in job requirements? 
├─ YES → Priority 1 (include with metrics)
└─ NO → Is this transferable/valuable?
   ├─ YES → Priority 2 (include with context)
   └─ NO → Priority 3 (space permitting)
```

**For Technical Skills:**
```
Does job description mention this technology?
├─ YES → Include in primary skills section
└─ NO → Is this adjacent/complementary?
   ├─ YES → Include in secondary section
   └─ NO → Omit unless space available
```

### **Phase 4: Version Assembly Strategy**

**1. Baseline Content (Always Include):**
- Core contact information
- Education (EPFL + HEIG-VD)
- Current Tandem role (abbreviated)
- Top 2-3 most relevant projects

**2. Variable Content Slots:**
- **Experience bullets**: Select top 4-6 per role based on job relevance
- **Skills emphasis**: Reorder sections based on job priority keywords
- **Projects**: Choose 2-3 most relevant with job-specific descriptions
- **Headline**: Craft job-specific value proposition

**3. Space Management:**
- Target: 2 pages maximum
- Priority 1 content: Must fit regardless
- Priority 2 content: Include if space permits
- Priority 3 content: Omit or move to cover letter

## **Implementation Workflow**

### **Weekly Application Process:**
1. **Job Analysis** (15 mins): Use your competency framework
2. **Content Mapping** (10 mins): Identify top 8-10 relevant experience bullets
3. **Template Selection** (5 mins): Choose appropriate LaTeX sections
4. **Assembly & Review** (10 mins): Generate PDF, keyword check
5. **Quality Control** (5 mins): Ensure 2-page limit, no orphaned text

### **Quality Metrics to Track:**
- Keyword match percentage vs. job description
- Results quantification ratio (aim for 60%+ of bullets)
- Application response rate by CV version
- Interview conversion rate by industry focus

## **Immediate Action Items**

1. **Enhance Metrics Collection**: Add specific numbers to your achievement database
   - Team sizes managed
   - Timeline improvements achieved  
   - Budget/resource amounts
   - Performance improvements (%)

2. **Keyword Database Update**: Build master list from 10-15 target job descriptions
   - Technical keywords by role type
   - Soft skill keywords by industry
   - Company culture keywords by size/type

3. **Achievement Impact Statements**: Rewrite top achievements with "So what?" test
   - "Led firmware development" → "Led firmware development delivering first FIH-compliant system, enabling $X clinical trial launch"

This systematic approach transforms your already-strong modular CV system into a precision targeting tool that maximizes relevance for each specific opportunity while maintaining authenticity to your background.
