Change the tables format so that I can easily bulk copy paste to my excel sheet

[4] ASSISTANT - 2025-06-06T08:46:40
--------------------------------------------------
The user wants me to reformat the tables so they can easily copy-paste into Excel. Excel works best with tab-separated values or a simple format that can be pasted directly. I should present the data in a more Excel-friendly format, probably removing the markdown table formatting and using a simpler layout that will paste cleanly into spreadsheet cells.

Let me reformat this to be more Excel-friendly:# **COMPETENCY EXTRACTION AND ASSESSMENT - EXCEL FORMAT**

The user wants me to reformat the competency assessment tables so they can easily copy-paste into Excel. I need to:

1. Use a format that Excel will automatically detect as tabular data
2. Use proper separators (likely tabs or consistent spacing)
3. Put the content in code blocks for easy copying
4. Make sure the format is clean and consistent

The best approach is to use tab-separated values or consistent spacing that Excel can parse automatically. I'll use the pipe separator (|) format but make it cleaner, or better yet, use tab-separated format which Excel handles very well.

Actually, the easiest for bulk copy-paste to Excel would be tab-separated values. Let me format it that way within code blocks.## **COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT - EXCEL READY FORMAT**
