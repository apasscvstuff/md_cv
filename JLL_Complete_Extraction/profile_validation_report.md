4. **Revise team leadership scope** (15+ engineers → ~5 consultants)

### **Content Corrections (Medium Priority)**
1. **Accurate project descriptions** based on user's actual work
2. **Honest skill positioning** (learning vs. production experience)
3. **Realistic achievement scope** without fabricated metrics
4. **Clear educational vs. professional distinctions**

### **Verification Strategy (Ongoing)**
1. **Source all claims** to user statements or career assessment
2. **Verify with user** any content not directly confirmed
3. **Create evidence backup** for any quantified claims retained
4. **Regular fact-checking** of any AI-generated additions

## Conclusion

The AI-generated CV content contains dangerous levels of fabrication that could seriously damage the user's professional credibility and career prospects. While the core technical foundation and career progression are accurately represented, the systematic creation of false metrics, invented projects, and inflated achievements creates significant legal and professional risks.

**The user should not use any AI-generated content without comprehensive fact-checking against verified sources.**

This analysis demonstrates the critical importance of human oversight when using AI tools for professional document creation, as the assistant's tendency to "fill gaps" with plausible-sounding fabrications can create serious professional liability.
