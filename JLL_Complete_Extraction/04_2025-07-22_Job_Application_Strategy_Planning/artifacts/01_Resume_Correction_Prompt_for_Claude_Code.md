# Resume Correction Prompt - Arthur Passuello AI Version

## Context
You need to correct Arthur Passuello's AI-focused resume by removing inaccurate claims and replacing them with truthful, compelling content based on his actual work experience. The goal is to maintain strong positioning for AI/ML roles while ensuring complete accuracy.

## Critical Accuracy Issues to Fix

### 1. Job Title Correction
**INCORRECT:** "AI/ML Engineer & Technical Lead"  
**CORRECT:** "Embedded Software Engineer & Technical Lead"

### 2. False Technical Claims to Remove/Replace
**REMOVE THESE INACCURATE BULLETS:**
- "ML Signal Processing: Developed real-time anomaly detection system for medical device using statistical learning, achieving 100% critical event detection with 0.1% false positive rate"
- "LLM Integration: Deployed local Llama 3.2 model for intelligent documentation search, implementing RAG system over 100MB technical docs, reducing lookup time by 75%"
- "Python Migration: Led transition from LabView to Python/ML stack, training 15+ engineers in NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, enabling data-driven development"

## Accurate Replacement Content

### Tandem Diabetes Care Switzerland Experience
**Position:** Embedded Software Engineer & Technical Lead  
**Period:** December 2022 - February 2025  
**Reference:** (Ref. Patrick Segura)

**ACCURATE ACHIEVEMENT BULLETS:**
- **Clinical Trial Leadership:** Led firmware development for Sigi™ insulin pump First In Human clinical trial, delivering complete system with two embedded applications and regulatory documentation accepted by authorities for human clinical study
- **HIL Test Infrastructure:** Architected and delivered Hardware-in-the-Loop test bench enabling complete pump hardware simulation and automated firmware validation, integrated into CI/CD pipeline and adopted by San Diego engineering team
- **Documentation Intelligence:** Designed comprehensive RAG system architecture for navigating complex technical documentation (100MB+ regulatory docs), reducing manual lookup processes through intelligent document retrieval (design phase completed, implementation planned)
- **Technical Leadership:** Served as technical reference for embedded software subprojects, mentoring team members while managing Scrum ceremonies, backlog planning, and cross-functional coordination with QA, RA, hardware, and clinical teams
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensured ISO-13485/IEC-62304 compliance throughout development lifecycle, managing software architecture, design specifications, interface descriptions, and regulatory documentation for medical device certification

**ACCURATE SKILLS TAGS:**
Replace current tags with: `Embedded Systems` `Medical Device Development` `ISO-13485` `IEC-62304` `Firmware Architecture` `HIL Systems` `Scrum Leadership` `Regulatory Compliance` `Cross-functional Coordination` `Technical Documentation` `PoC Development` `Clinical Trial Support`

### Maintain These Accurate Sections
Keep the following sections unchanged as they are accurate:
- IMD Business School experience 
- ADEPT Neuro SA experience
- All project sections (RAG system, multimodal AI, DeepWeb analysis)
- Education section
- Contact information and tagline

## Strategic Positioning Adjustments

### 1. Tagline Refinement
**CURRENT:** "Applied AI/ML Engineer | Production Systems & Education"  
**SUGGESTED:** "Embedded Systems Engineer | AI/ML Integration | Clinical Device Development"

### 2. Skills Table Enhancement
Add a "Medical & Regulatory" column to highlight unique value:
```
Medical & Regulatory | ML & LLMs | Software Engineering
✓ ISO-13485 • IEC-62304 | ✓ PyTorch • TensorFlow | ✓ Python • C++
✓ Clinical Trials | ✓ Transformers • LLMs | ✓ FastAPI • REST
✓ V&V Documentation | ✓ RAG • Vector Search | ✓ Git Version Control
✓ Medical Device Safety | ✓ Multimodal AI | ✓ Docker • CI/CD
✓ Regulatory Compliance | ✓ Constitutional AI | ✓ Technical Leadership
✓ Cross-functional Teams | ✓ Neural Networks | ✓ System Architecture
```

## Key Messaging Strategy

### For Medical AI Positions (like Hilo)
