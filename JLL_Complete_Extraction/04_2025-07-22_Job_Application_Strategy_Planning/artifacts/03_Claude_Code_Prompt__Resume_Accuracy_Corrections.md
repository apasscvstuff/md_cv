# Resume Accuracy Correction Prompt for Claude Code

## Context
You need to correct factual inaccuracies in Arthur Passuello's AI-focused resume. The resume contains several exaggerated or fabricated claims that need to be replaced with accurate information based on his actual experience.

## Critical Corrections Required

### 1. TANDEM DIABETES CARE POSITION (Most Critical)

**Current (INCORRECT):**
```
Position: "AI/ML Engineer & Technical Lead"
```

**Correct To:**
```
Position: "Embedded Software Engineer & Technical Lead"
```

**Current Experience Bullets (INCORRECT - Remove Completely):**
- "ML Signal Processing: Developed real-time anomaly detection system for medical device using statistical learning, achieving 100% critical event detection with 0.1% false positive rate"
- "LLM Integration: Deployed local Llama 3.2 model for intelligent documentation search, implementing RAG system over 100MB technical docs, reducing lookup time by 75%"
- "Python Migration: Led transition from LabView to Python/ML stack, training 15+ engineers in NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, enabling data-driven development"

**Replace With (ACCURATE):**
- "**Clinical Trial Leadership:** Led firmware development for Sigi™ insulin pump delivering FDA-compliant system for First In Human clinical trial, ensuring ISO-13485/IEC-62304 compliance with comprehensive regulatory documentation"
- "**Technical Infrastructure:** Developed comprehensive HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) test infrastructure achieving 96% code coverage, enabling automated firmware validation and accelerating development cycles by 40%"
- "**Cross-functional Leadership:** Organized and facilitated Scrum ceremonies (standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, demos) while coordinating with hardware, QA, regulatory affairs, and clinical teams across multiple time zones"
- "**Embedded Architecture:** Designed and implemented embedded software architecture for medical device combining Bluetooth communication stack with real-time insulin delivery protocols and safety-critical algorithms"
- "**Documentation & Compliance:** Created comprehensive software architecture documentation, design specifications, and interface descriptions meeting medical device regulatory standards (ISO-13485/IEC-62304)"

### 2. IMD BUSINESS SCHOOL POSITION

**Current (EXAGGERATED):**
```
Position: "Lead AI/ML Instructor & Curriculum Designer"
```

**Correct To:**
```
Position: "AI/ML Teaching Assistant & Educational Content Developer"
```

**Keep These (ACCURATE):**
- The 4.8/5.0 rating and 100+ international executives
- The hands-on curriculum development
- The technical translation to business leaders

**Add Accuracy Note:**
- Change "designed 40-hour curriculum" to "contributed to 40-hour curriculum design and delivery"

### 3. PROJECT CORRECTIONS

**Enterprise RAG System Project:**
- Keep the technical details (they're accurate from his portfolio work)
- Clarify this is a **personal project**, not professional work
- Update description to: "**Personal Portfolio Project:** Architected production RAG processing..."

**MultiModal AI Research Implementation:**
- Keep as-is (this is accurate personal research work)

### 4. SKILLS SECTION CORRECTIONS

**Current "ML & LLMs" Column - Remove:**
- Any claims about production ML deployment at work
- References to work-based LLM integration

**Keep/Add in "ML & LLMs" Column:**
- ✓ PyTorch • TensorFlow (educational/personal)
- ✓ Transformers • LLMs (research/personal)
- ✓ RAG • Vector Search (portfolio)
- ✓ Multimodal AI (research)
- ✓ Constitutional AI (research)
- ✓ Neural Networks • Deep Learning (educational)

**Add to "Software Engineering" Column:**
- ✓ Embedded C/C++ 
- ✓ Medical Device Development
- ✓ ISO-13485 • IEC-62304
- ✓ Hardware-Software Integration
- ✓ Real-time Systems

### 5. TIMELINE CORRECTIONS

**Update Tandem period to reflect accuracy:**
```
Current: "December 2022 - Today"
Correct: "December 2022 - February 2025"
```

## Positioning Strategy

### Overall Narrative
Arthur is an **Embedded Software Engineer** with **strong AI/ML knowledge** who is **transitioning into AI/ML roles**. He has:
- Solid medical device firmware experience
- Strong educational background in AI/ML
- Personal portfolio demonstrating AI capabilities
- Teaching experience showing ability to communicate complex concepts

### Key Value Propositions to Maintain
1. **Medical Device Expertise:** Regulatory compliance, safety-critical systems
2. **Technical Leadership:** Scrum facilitation, cross-functional coordination  
3. **AI/ML Foundation:** EPFL education + personal projects + teaching experience
4. **Swiss Market Advantage:** Location, language, regulatory knowledge

## Additional Instructions

1. **Maintain Professional Tone:** All corrections should sound professional and confident
2. **Quantify Where Possible:** Keep specific metrics that are verifiable (96% test coverage, 4.8/5.0 rating)
3. **Emphasize Transition:** Make it clear he's transitioning from embedded to AI/ML, not claiming current AI/ML production experience
4. **Swiss Context:** Emphasize Swiss location, language skills, and regulatory knowledge
