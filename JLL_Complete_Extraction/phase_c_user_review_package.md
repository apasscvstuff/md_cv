## Items Requiring Your Review

### **For Confirmation**

#### **Training Context Clarification**
**Claim:** Different numbers mentioned for training activities
- Python training: "Around 15, no measurable learning outcomes except that a team completely switched from LabView to Python" (Conv 14)
- IMD teaching: "100+ MBA students" (multiple conversations)

**Question:** Are these separate contexts? Please confirm:
- Python training = internal team training at Tandem (~15 colleagues)
- IMD teaching = external MBA student instruction (100+ students over 4 years)

**Why this matters:** Important for accurately quantifying your teaching/mentoring experience

#### **Proof-of-Concept Delivery**
**Claim:** "I delivered 6 PoCs. They adopted one of them and got overall excellent feedback (but no precise metric)" (Conv 14)

**Question:** Is this count complete and accurate for your time at Tandem?

**Why this matters:** Demonstrates innovation and stakeholder value delivery

#### **Sensor Fusion Accuracy**
**Claim:** "100% accuracy and precision. No embedded AI/ML but used statistical algorithm to dynamically calibrate the sensors and detection threshold at boot" (Conv 14)

**Question:** Can you confirm the methodology that achieved this 100% accuracy? Was this validated through testing?

**Why this matters:** Ensures precision in technical claims for interviews

### **For Clarification**

#### **Technical Terminology Preferences**
**Observation:** You carefully distinguished between statistical algorithms vs ML approaches

**Question:** For CV presentation, do you prefer to:
- Emphasize "statistical algorithms" for sensor work
- Use "AI/ML integration evaluation" for design work
- Maintain clear boundaries between implementation vs design

**Why this matters:** Ensures consistent and accurate technical positioning
