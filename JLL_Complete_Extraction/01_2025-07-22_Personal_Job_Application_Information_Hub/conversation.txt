Help me prepare a prompt that I will give to claude code running in my two projects (multimodal and rag, two different sessions) for it to extract all the information relevant for job applications. Let's start by brainstorming what it would look like (I really want to be thorough and definitive) and I'm open to anything that will get me relevant data. I also want to find a solution to centralize all my personnal information (career assessment, project portfolio, job profile seeked, work information, personal preferences, etc...) to avoid running in circle like I've been recently. Let's start brainstorming.

The user (Arthur) is asking me to help him create a comprehensive prompt for Claude Code that will extract all information relevant for job applications from his two projects (multimodal and rag). He wants to be thorough and definitive, and also wants to find a solution to centralize all his personal information to avoid running in circles.

Let me think about this systematically:

1. First, I need to understand what kinds of information would be relevant for job applications from technical projects
2. Then think about how to structure this information extraction
3. Consider centralization strategies
4. Create a comprehensive prompt structure

Before I respond, I should search the project knowledge to understand Arthur's current situation and what information might already be available.
```

```

There seems to be an error with the project knowledge search. Let me try a different query to see if I can access Arthur's information.
```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.
```

It seems there's an issue with the project knowledge search function. Let me proceed with the brainstorming based on the context provided in the prompt. Arthur is transitioning from embedded systems to AI/ML roles and has two projects (multimodal and RAG) that he wants to extract information from for job applications. He also wants to centralize all his personal information.

Let me create a comprehensive brainstorming approach for both the information extraction prompt and the centralization strategy.Excellent strategic thinking, Arthur! Creating a comprehensive information extraction system and centralization hub is exactly what you need to streamline your job application process. Let me brainstorm a thorough approach with you.

--------------------------------------------------
It's not so much that I want a comprehensive information extraction system, it's that I've been struggling so far. The context is so vast that Claude constantly oscillates between missing the point, losing focus, inventing things, etc.

I have now a pletora of conversation with Claude that may have relevant context but I don't know what to do with it, it's going in every direction and I'm not making progress. This is why I need help. The issue is complex and the scope is vast, so don't jump to a solution yet.

[4] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T17:29:37
--------------------------------------------------
Ah, I see. Arthur is highlighting a much more fundamental problem - he's experiencing the classic "knowledge management chaos" that happens when you have extensive conversations with AI but no structured way to capture, organize, and build upon the insights. He's not asking for another complex system - he's stuck in analysis paralysis with too much unstructured information scattered across multiple Claude conversations.

The real issue he's describing:
1. Too much context spread across many conversations
2. Claude keeps losing focus/missing the point
3. Inventing details instead of using actual information
4. No clear progress despite lots of effort
5. Information going in every direction without consolidation

He's asking me to understand the problem deeply before jumping to solutions. Let me acknowledge this complexity and help him think through the core issues first.You're absolutely right to pump the brakes - I was jumping straight into solution mode when you're describing a much more fundamental problem. Let me understand what you're actually dealing with.

**The Real Problem You're Facing:**
You're drowning in your own research. You have tons of Claude conversations with potentially valuable insights, but it's become an unmanageable mess where:
- Each new conversation starts from scratch
- Context gets lost or diluted across sessions  
- Claude keeps reinventing or assuming instead of building on actual information
- You can't see the forest for the trees
- Progress feels circular rather than cumulative

**The Meta-Problem:**
The very tool that should be helping you (Claude) is contributing to the chaos because it can't maintain context across conversations or distinguish between what you've actually told it versus what it's inferring or creating.

**Questions to understand your situation better:**

1. **Scope of the mess**: Roughly how many Claude conversations are we talking about? Are they spread across different topics (resume writing, job search strategy, technical projects, career planning) or more focused?

2. **Content overlap**: Are you finding yourself re-explaining the same background information repeatedly across conversations?

3. **Progress blockers**: What specifically happens when you try to consolidate? Do you get overwhelmed by volume, lose track of what's valuable, or find contradictory advice?

4. **Current state**: Do you have any organized notes/documents from these conversations, or is everything just sitting in chat histories?

5. **Decision fatigue**: Are you spending more time managing the information than actually applying it?

Before we think about solutions, I want to understand: What does "making progress" look like to you right now? What would be the first concrete step that would make you feel like you're moving forward rather than spinning your wheels?

[5] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T17:35:53
--------------------------------------------------
1. All conversation are located in this Claude Project. They cover many topics (all the ones you mentioned plus job offer analysis, resume markdown system setup, etc.)
2. Most of my background information is in the project's knowledge and my github repository (portfolio projects and resume) but it's polluted with incorrect information (generated by claude mostly) and sometimes incomplete. I keep repeating the same instructions and hit the same dead-end in different conversations. I'm not able to converge. I'm also using claude code locally to help with my resume and projects
3. The volume is overwhelming, even for Claude who starts to deviate from the context and its instructions. I lose track and end up with incomplete or, worse, incorrect results.
4. It's mostly in chat histories. The only sort of "log" or documents are in my portfolio and cv projects but it's not 100% reliable
5. Yes


Making progress would be converging to a complete resume, finding a working system to process job offers, find a way to keep track of previously gained insights for future use and efficiently orient my projects according to my goals and reachable opportunities.

[6] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T17:36:16
--------------------------------------------------
Now I understand the real problem Arthur is facing. This is a classic case of "death by a thousand contexts" - he's created an information management nightmare where:

1. He has a Claude Project with tons of conversations covering multiple job search topics
2. His project knowledge base contains his real info mixed with Claude's hallucinations/assumptions
3. He's stuck in loops - repeating same explanations, hitting same dead-ends
4. Even Claude can't handle the volume and starts deviating 
5. His "source of truth" documents (portfolio, CV) are polluted with incorrect Claude-generated content
6. He's also using Claude Code locally, adding another layer of complexity
7. He's experiencing decision fatigue from managing information rather than using it

The core issue is **information integrity breakdown** - he can't trust his own documentation because it's been contaminated, and he can't make progress because every conversation starts polluted or goes in circles.

What he needs is NOT another system, but a way to:
1. Establish a clean "source of truth" baseline
2. Create boundaries to prevent future pollution
3. Extract value from the mess without getting lost in it
4. Build a sustainable workflow that doesn't recreate the problem

I should focus on understanding the contamination problem and how to establish clean foundations before thinking about extraction or systems.Now I see the real problem - you've created an **information integrity crisis**. Your "source of truth" is contaminated with Claude's hallucinations, and every new conversation inherits this pollution, creating compound errors and endless loops.

This is actually a common but rarely discussed problem with AI-assisted work: **context contamination cascade**.

**The Contamination Cycle You're Stuck In:**
1. Claude generates/assumes something incorrect about your background
2. That gets mixed into your project knowledge or documents  
3. Future Claude conversations read that as "fact" about you
4. New conversations build on these false foundations
5. You spend time correcting, but corrections get lost across sessions
6. The cycle repeats, making your data progressively less reliable

**Critical Questions to Map the Damage:**

**Contamination Assessment:**
- In your project knowledge, can you identify what's definitely true vs. what Claude might have generated?
- Are there specific recurring "facts" about your experience that you keep having to correct?
- Have you noticed Claude referencing achievements/projects/skills you never actually told it about?

**Clean Information Sources:**
- What sources do you still trust completely (your actual GitHub repos, official transcripts, real project codebases)?
- Do you have any pre-Claude documentation about your background that's definitely clean?

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Are there specific topics where the loops happen most (technical skills, project descriptions, career timeline)?
- Do you find yourself saying "No, that's not right" repeatedly about the same things?

**The Real Decision:**
Before any system design, you need to decide: **Are you willing to start with a clean slate foundation, even if it means temporarily "losing" some insights from the contaminated conversations?**

Because trying to extract value from polluted data might just perpetuate the cycle. Sometimes the fastest path forward is burning the corrupted database and rebuilding from trusted sources.

What's your gut reaction to potentially starting fresh with only verified information?

[7] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T17:40:41
--------------------------------------------------
* Contamination Assessment: Yes I can identify when I'm looking at it. Claude keeps inventing performance metrics in my project reports, it keeps inventing ML/AI achievements/skills when I try to simply orient or find relevant content for my resume/cover letter. Yes I did notice that.
* Clean Information Sources: My career assesment, some conversation content, my actual code and test reports/implementation reports, etc. Yes I have that (my career assesment) but it's not completely up-to-date (it especially lacks information about my recent AI/ML projects achievements)
* Pattern Recognition: technical skills, project descriptions, work experience, test results. Yes.

[8] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T17:40:59
--------------------------------------------------
Now I have a clear picture of Arthur's situation:

1. He has contamination problems where Claude keeps inventing things about his background, especially ML/AI achievements and performance metrics
2. He has some clean sources (career assessment, actual code, implementation reports)
3. The contamination is happening in predictable patterns around technical skills, project descriptions, work experience, and test results
4. He has a career assessment that's clean but outdated (missing recent AI/ML project info)

The key insight here is that he needs to:
1. First establish clean, verified baseline information 
2. Then systematically extract ONLY factual information from his actual projects/code
3. Build a contamination-resistant system going forward

I should help him think through a recovery strategy that:
- Starts with his clean sources
- Methodically adds only verifiable information 
- Creates safeguards against future contamination
- Gives him a clear path to convergence

I should not jump to solutions yet, but help him think through the recovery approach and what the clean rebuild would look like.Perfect - you've identified the infection vectors clearly. This gives us a precise recovery strategy.

**The Clean Rebuild Approach:**

You have two viable paths, and I want to hear your instinct on which feels more manageable:

**Path A: Radical Clean Slate**
- Start with your clean career assessment + actual code/reports only
- Systematically add ONLY what you can verify from primary sources
- Quarantine all Claude-generated content until you can verify it against reality
- Rebuild resume/application system from this verified foundation

**Path B: Surgical Extraction**  
- Keep the contaminated project knowledge but mark it as "unverified"
- Create a parallel "verified only" knowledge base
- Methodically move items from contaminated → verified as you confirm them
- More work, but preserves potentially valuable insights buried in the mess

**Key Recovery Questions:**

1. **Scope Reality Check**: How long would it realistically take you to update your career assessment with your recent AI/ML project achievements using only your actual implementation reports and code?

2. **Verification Method**: For your recent projects, what's the most reliable way to extract true achievements? (Run tests? Review actual code commits? Check real performance logs?)

3. **Risk Tolerance**: Would you rather risk losing some potentially valuable insights to ensure clean data, or risk perpetuating contamination to preserve everything?

4. **Energy Assessment**: Do you have more energy for "cleaning up a mess" or "starting fresh with a clear system"?

My instinct is that Path A might be faster to convergence, but I want to hear what your gut says about which approach feels less overwhelming to you right now.

[9] HUMAN - 2025-07-23T17:41:51
--------------------------------------------------
Would it be somewhat feasible to scrape my conversations with claude and try to extract its content ? Then systematically review it.

[10] ASSISTANT - 2025-07-23T17:42:07
--------------------------------------------------
The user is asking about scraping their Claude conversations to extract content and systematically review it. This is essentially asking about extracting and organizing information from their own conversations - not reproducing copyrighted material. This seems like a legitimate technical question about data extraction and organization.

They want to know if it's feasible to scrape their conversations and then systematically review the content to separate what's useful from what's contaminated.

This is different from the clean slate vs surgical extraction paths I outlined - this is more like "automated surgical extraction" where they'd use tooling to help them process the large volume of conversations more systematically.

I should respond helpfully about the feasibility and approach for this, while being realistic about the challenges.**Yes, this is actually a smart hybrid approach** - automated extraction + human verification. It could be more thorough than Path A while being more manageable than manual Path B.

**Feasibility Assessment:**

**Technical Side:**
- Your conversations are in this Claude project, so they should be accessible
- Text extraction from conversations is straightforward 
- You could use Claude Code to help process and categorize the extracted content
- Pattern matching could identify recurring topics/claims for systematic review

**Practical Challenges:**
- **Volume Processing**: Even with automation, you'll still need to human-verify everything
- **Context Loss**: Extracted snippets might lose important context from the conversation flow
- **Categorization Complexity**: Separating "Arthur said this" vs "Claude assumed this" isn't always clear in conversation transcripts

**Potential Workflow:**
1. **Extract & Categorize**: Pull all conversations, organize by topic (resume, projects, skills, etc.)
2. **Flag Pattern Claims**: Automatically identify recurring assertions about your background
3. **Verification Queue**: Create systematic review lists (e.g., "All technical skills mentioned", "All project metrics claimed")
4. **Binary Sorting**: For each item: Keep (verified) / Discard (fabricated) / Investigate (unclear)

**Key Question:** Do you have access to export/download your conversation history from this project? Or would you need to manually copy-paste conversations for processing?

If you can export the data, this approach could actually be the most thorough - you'd catch valuable insights that might get lost in a clean slate approach while still maintaining verification discipline.

What's your technical setup like for potentially automating this extraction?
