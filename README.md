# üìÑ Arthur Passuello CV System

A sophisticated markdown-based CV generation system that creates multiple targeted CV versions from YAML content files. Inspired by Fran√ßois Quellec's elegant design, this system preserves advanced conditional logic while providing modern maintainability.

## üéØ What This System Does

This system transforms structured YAML content into beautiful, professional CVs in multiple formats:

- **5 Targeted CV Versions**: Firmware, AI, Consulting, Executive, General
- **3 Output Formats**: Markdown, HTML, PDF
- **Conditional Content**: Smart filtering based on audience and priorities
- **Professional Design**: Fran√ßois Quellec-inspired layout with modern typography
- **Version Control Friendly**: All content stored as human-readable YAML

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install pyyaml

# Install pandoc for HTML generation
brew install pandoc  # macOS
# or: sudo apt install pandoc  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Install WeasyPrint dependencies (for best PDF quality)
brew install gobject-introspection cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate all CV versions (markdown only)
python build_system.py all

# Generate HTML versions (recommended)
python build_system.py --html all

# Generate PDF versions (high quality)
python build_system.py --pdf all

# Generate everything (markdown + HTML + PDF)
python build_system.py --all-formats all

# Generate specific version
python build_system.py --all-formats firmware
```

## üìÅ System Architecture

### Content Structure

```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arthur-personal.yaml     # Personal info, contact details, languages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arthur-skills.yaml       # Technical skills with version targeting
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arthur-experience.yaml   # Work experience with conditional content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arthur-projects.yaml     # Projects with version-specific descriptions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ arthur-education.yaml    # Education and certifications
```

### Output Structure

```
output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firmware/               # Embedded systems focused
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/                    # AI/ML practitioner focused  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ consulting/            # Business impact focused
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ executive/             # Leadership focused (1-page)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ general/               # Balanced technical/business
```

Each version directory contains:
- `arthur-{version}.md` - Source markdown
- `arthur-{version}.html` - Styled HTML with assets
- `arthur-{version}.pdf` - High-quality PDF
- `assets/` - Profile image and contact icons
- `css_styling.css` - Web version styling
- `css_styling_print.css` - PDF-optimized styling

## üîß How the Conditional Logic Works

### Version Targeting

Content can be targeted to specific CV versions using the `versions` array:

```yaml
# Include only in specific versions
versions: ["firmware", "ai"]

# Include in all versions  
versions: ["all"]

# Exclude from executive (include in others)
versions: ["firmware", "ai", "consulting", "general"]
```

### Priority System

Content is filtered by priority levels:

```yaml
priority: 1  # Core content (shown in ALL versions, including executive)
priority: 2  # Standard details (hidden in executive, shown in others)
priority: 3  # Full details (only in detailed versions: firmware/ai)
```

### Achievement Types

Different achievement types for targeted emphasis:

```yaml
type: "base"              # Standard achievement
type: "techmetric"        # Technical measurement (96% test coverage)
type: "leadmetric"        # Leadership impact (7+ direct reports)
type: "businessimpact"    # Business value (10x performance improvement)
type: "ai_focus"          # AI/ML specific
type: "consulting_focus"  # Client/business focused
```

## üìù Content Modification Guide

### 1. Personal Information (`arthur-personal.yaml`)

```yaml
personal:
  name: "Arthur PASSUELLO"
  phone: "+(41) 79 176 24 84"
  email: "apassuello@protonmail.com"
  address: "Chemin du Parc-de-Valency 1, 1004 Lausanne, Suisse"
  github: "apassuello"
  linkedin: "arthur-passuello" 
  linkedin_name: "Arthur Passuello"
  languages: "French (native) ‚Ä¢ English (Professional) ‚Ä¢ German (B1)"
  profile_photo: "assets/profile.jpeg"
```

**To modify**: Update any field directly. The system will automatically use these values across all CV versions.

### 2. Skills Configuration (`arthur-skills.yaml`)

The skills system supports two layouts:

#### Executive Layout (streamlined)
```yaml
executive:
  leadership_impact:
    - skill: "Technical Team Leadership"
      metric: "7+ Direct Reports"
      type: "leadmetric"
  business_results:
    - skill: "Cost Optimization"  
      metric: "‚Ç¨2M+ Annual Savings"
      type: "businessimpact"
```

#### Technical Layout (3-column table)
```yaml
technical:
  programming_languages:
    firmware: ["C/C++ (Expert)", "Python (Expert)", "VHDL"]
    ai: ["Python (Expert)", "PyTorch", "TensorFlow"]
    consulting: ["Python (Expert)", "SQL", "R"]
  
  core_technologies:
    firmware: ["FreeRTOS", "STM32", "FPGA Development"]
    ai: ["OpenAI/Anthropic APIs", "RAG Systems", "Vector Databases"]
```

**To add new skills**:
1. Add to appropriate category in `technical` section
2. Specify which versions should show each skill
3. For executive version, add to `executive` section with metrics

### 3. Work Experience (`arthur-experience.yaml`)

```yaml
experiences:
  - company: "Tandem Diabetes Care Switzerland"
    location: "Lausanne, Switzerland"
    period: "December 2022 - June 2025"
    versions: ["firmware", "ai", "consulting", "executive", "general"]
    
    # Different job titles per version
    position_variants:
      firmware: "Embedded Software Engineer"
      ai: "Embedded Software Engineer"
      executive: "Senior Technical Lead"
    
    reference: "(Ref. Patrick Segura)"
    
    # Version-specific skill tags
    skills_tags:
      firmware: "C/C++ ‚Ä¢ FreeRTOS ‚Ä¢ Medical Devices"
      ai: "Python ‚Ä¢ ML ‚Ä¢ System Integration"
    
    achievements:
      # Core achievement (all versions)
      - text: "Led firmware development for Sigi‚Ñ¢ insulin pump"
        versions: ["all"]
        priority: 1
        type: "base"
      
      # Technical detail (not in executive)
      - text: "achieving 96% test coverage through HIL system"
        versions: ["firmware", "ai", "consulting", "general"] 
        priority: 2
        type: "techmetric"
      
      # Detailed technical info (only detailed versions)
      - text: "Established test infrastructure for medical-grade firmware verification"
        versions: ["firmware", "ai"]
        priority: 3
        type: "base"
```

**To add new experience**:
1. Copy the structure above
2. Customize `position_variants` for different audiences
3. Use `versions` and `priority` to control content visibility
4. Add relevant `type` for proper emphasis

### 4. Projects (`arthur-projects.yaml`)

```yaml
projects:
  - name: "Technical Documentation RAG System"
    period: "Jan 2025 - Present"
    versions: ["ai", "consulting", "general", "firmware"]
    
    links:
      github: "https://github.com/apassuello/technical-doc-rag/"
      demo: "https://huggingface.co/spaces/ArthyP/technical-rag-assistant"
    
    # Different descriptions per version
    descriptions:
      ai:
        - "Architected RAG platform achieving 99.5% chunk quality"

    skills_tags:
      ai: "Python ‚Ä¢ RAG ‚Ä¢ Vector Databases"
      firmware: "RISC-V ‚Ä¢ Real-time Systems"
```

**To add new project**:
1. Define which versions should include it
2. Write version-specific descriptions focusing on relevant aspects
3. Add appropriate links and skills tags

## üé® Layout Modification Framework

### CSS Customization System

The system uses two CSS files for different purposes:

#### `css_styling.css` (Web/HTML viewing)
- Full Fran√ßois Quellec design with modern web features
- Perfect for viewing CVs in browsers
- Supports hover effects, smooth scrolling

#### `css_styling_print.css` (PDF generation)
- Print-optimized version for WeasyPrint
- A4 page sizing with proper margins
- Page break control and typography optimization

### Easy Layout Modifications with Claude Code

This system is designed for easy customization using Claude Code. Here's how:

#### 1. **Color Scheme Changes**

```
"Change the accent color from red (#dc3545) to blue throughout the CV system"
```

Claude will:
- Update both CSS files consistently
- Modify the profile picture border color
- Update link colors and section dividers
- Ensure print and web versions match

#### 2. **Typography Adjustments**

Ask Claude Code:
```
"Make the CV more compact by reducing font sizes and line spacing by 15%"
```

Claude will:
- Proportionally adjust all font sizes in both CSS files
- Maintain visual hierarchy while reducing space usage
- Update print margins for better page utilization

#### 3. **Layout Structure Changes**

Ask Claude Code:
```
"Change the skills table from 3 columns to 2 columns and make the profile picture smaller"
```

Claude will:

- Update CSS grid layouts
- Adjust profile picture sizing
- Ensure consistency across all CV versions

#### 4. **Section Reordering**

Ask Claude Code:
```
"Move the Projects section before Work Experience in all versions"
```

Claude will:
- Reorder sections in the markdown generation methods
- Ensure proper spacing and flow
- Maintain conditional logic for all versions

#### 5. **Content Format Changes**

Ask Claude Code:
```
"Add a new 'Certifications' section that appears after Skills but only in technical versions"
```

Claude will:
- Add YAML structure for certifications
- Create processing logic with version conditions
- Generate appropriate markdown formatting
- Update all relevant files consistently

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Build System (`build_system.py`)

The core `CVBuilder` class handles:

- **Version Management**: 5 predefined CV versions with unique configurations
- **Content Processing**: YAML ‚Üí filtered content ‚Üí Markdown
- **Asset Management**: Copies images, icons, and CSS files to output directories  
- **Multi-format Output**: Markdown ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí PDF pipeline
- **Conditional Logic**: Complex filtering based on versions, priorities, and types

### Key Methods:

- `build_version()`: Generates markdown for specific version
- `build_html()`: Converts markdown to styled HTML with assets
- `build_pdf()`: Multi-method PDF generation (WeasyPrint ‚Üí Pandoc ‚Üí Manual)
- `process_*_section()`: Version-specific content filtering for each section

### PDF Generation Pipeline:

1. **WeasyPrint** (preferred): Best quality, preserves CSS styling
2. **Chrome Headless**: Browser-based rendering (if available)  
3. **Pandoc**: LaTeX-based fallback
4. **Manual Instructions**: User guidance for browser print-to-PDF

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### WeasyPrint Not Working
```bash
# Install system dependencies
brew install gobject-introspection cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi

# Check environment
echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH
echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

#### Assets Not Showing in PDF
- Verify assets exist in `assets/` directory (not just `.placeholder` files)
- Check that `build_html()` was run before `build_pdf()`
- Ensure proper file permissions

#### Content Not Appearing in Expected Version
```yaml
# Check version targeting in YAML
versions: ["firmware", "ai"]  # Make sure target version is included

# Check priority levels
priority: 1  # Executive shows only priority 1
priority: 2  # Hidden in executive, shown in others  
priority: 3  # Only in detailed versions
```

#### PDF Quality Issues
- Use WeasyPrint for best quality: `--pdf` flag
- For manual control: Generate HTML first, then print to PDF in browser
- Check `css_styling_print.css` for print-specific optimizations

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test content processing without building
python build_system.py --test firmware

# Generate HTML only (always works)
python build_system.py --html all

# Verbose output for troubleshooting
python build_system.py --verbose firmware
```
